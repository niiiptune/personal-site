<li>Summary: &quot;Outlive&quot; delves into the author&#x27;s journey in understanding longevity and chronic diseases. The focus shifts from delaying disease to maintaining physical and mental functions for a longer, healthier life. The text emphasizes the importance of addressing metabolic health to lower risks and prevent chronic diseases. It advocates for a holistic approach involving exercise, nutrition, emotional health, and cognitive function to improve healthspan and potentially extend lifespan. The narrative explores various interventions, such as exercise and metabolic health management, to promote longevity and overall well-being.</li>

<li>The reason why goes back to my dream about the falling eggs. In short, it had finally dawned on me that the only way to solve the problem was not to get better at catching the eggs. Instead, we needed to try to stop the guy who was throwing them. We had to figure out how to get to the top of the building, find the guy, and take him out.

<li>Each one of the Horsemen is cumulative, the product of multiple risk factors adding up and compounding over time. Many of these same individual risk factors, it turns out, are relatively easy to reduce or even eliminate. Even better, they share certain features or drivers in common that make them vulnerable to some of the same tactics and behavioral changes we will discuss in this book (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrq8canhjfe80zcsy7eqepyr">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>This is how I see my role: I am not a laboratory scientist or clinical researcher but more of a translator, helping you understand and apply these insights. This requires a thorough understanding of the science but also a bit of art, just as if we were translating a poem by Shakespeare into another language. We have to get the meaning of the words exactly right (the science), while also capturing the tone, the nuance, the feeling, and the rhythm (the art). Similarly, my approach to longevity is firmly rooted in science, but there is also a good deal of art in figuring out how and when to apply our knowledge to you, the patient, with your specific genes, your history and habits, and your goals.

</li>
<li>But my intent here is not to tell you exactly <em>what to do;</em> it‚Äôs to help you learn <em>how to think</em> about doing these things*.* For me, that has been the journey, an obsessive process of study and iteration that began that day on the rocky shore of Catalina Island.

<li>This represented a major philosophical shift, from observing and guessing to observing, and then forming a hypothesis, which as Richard Feynman pointed out is basically a fancy word for a guess. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrqahbsy4xcwdb4y65yjzwbq">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>The next step is crucial: rigorously testing that hypothesis/guess to determine whether it is correct, also known as experimenting. Instead of using treatments that they <em>believed</em> might work, often despite ample anecdotal evidence to the contrary, scientists and physicians could systematically test and evaluate potential cures, then choose the ones that had performed best in experiments. Yet three centuries elapsed between Bacon‚Äôs essay and the discovery of penicillin, the true game-changer of Medicine 2.0.

<li>First, <em>Medicine 3.0 places a far greater emphasis on prevention than treatment</em> (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrra03wfx3r2xmej4qyahmbh">View Highlight</a>)</li>

<li>In Medicine 3.0, our starting point is the honest assessment, and acceptance, of risk‚Äîincluding the risk of doing nothing (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrra19nds12hmf55rbrxymh2">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>This reported 24 percent risk increase sounded scary indeed. But nobody seemed to care that the <em>absolute</em> risk increase of breast cancer for women in¬†the study remained minuscule (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrra9x2bt0q5kvm5z70ak37t">View Highlight</a>)<!-- -->

<li>Note: Numbers can lie. Relative % without absolute value means nothing.</li>

<li>The fourth and perhaps largest shift is that where Medicine 2.0 focuses largely on lifespan, and is almost entirely geared toward staving off death, <em>Medicine 3.0 pays far more attention to maintaining healthspan, the quality of life.</em> (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrrawcw6gs4y1d28y0bp8hjk">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>Beginning in her early seventies, Sophie had undergone a steep physical decline that began when she slipped and fell while gardening, tearing a muscle in her shoulder. That soon escalated into back and neck pain so severe that she could no longer work in the garden or play golf at all, her two primary passions in retirement. She simply sat around the house, feeling depressed. This was followed by a descent into dementia in the last couple of years of her life, before she died of a respiratory infection at age eighty-three.

<li>Medicine 2.0 relies on two types of tactics, broadly speaking: procedures (e.g., surgery) and medications. Our tactics in Medicine 3.0 fall into five broad domains: exercise, nutrition, sleep, emotional health, and exogenous molecules, meaning drugs, hormones, or supplements.

<li>We‚Äôre trying to attack heart disease, cancer, stroke, and Alzheimer‚Äôs one disease at a time, as if somehow these diseases are all unrelated to each other, (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrtt58jckb1kh6w49t4zfqmv">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>Why do we care about mTOR? Because this mechanism turns out to be one of the most important mediators of longevity at the cellular level. Not only that, but it is highly ‚Äúconserved,‚Äù meaning it is found in virtually all forms of life, ranging from yeast to flies to worms and right on up to us humans. In biology, ‚Äúconserved‚Äù means that something has been passed on via natural selection, across multiple species and classes of organisms‚Äîa sign that evolution has deemed it to be very important. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrtx9jtpcvgh5bqjjesz34yx">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>The job of mTOR is basically to balance an organism‚Äôs need to grow and reproduce against the availability of nutrients. When food is plentiful, mTOR is activated and the cell (or the organism) goes into growth mode, producing new proteins and undergoing cell division, as with the ultimate goal of reproduction. When nutrients are scarce, mTOR is suppressed and cells go into a kind of ‚Äúrecycling‚Äù mode, breaking down cellular components and generally cleaning house. Cell division and growth slow down or stop, and reproduction is put on hold to allow the organism to conserve energy.

<li>In the 1980s, Reaven labeled this collection of related disorders ‚ÄúSyndrome X‚Äù‚Äîwhere the X factor, he eventually determined, was insulin resistance. Today we call this cluster of problems ‚Äúmetabolic syndrome‚Äù (or MetSyn), and it is defined in terms of the following five criteria:<!-- -->

<li>About 75¬†percent of this glycogen ends up in skeletal muscle and the other 25¬†percent goes to the liver, although this ratio can vary.

<li>Individual fat-storage capacity seems to be influenced by genetic factors.

<li>Fructose isn‚Äôt the only thing that creates uric acid; foods high in chemicals called purines, such as certain meats, cheeses, anchovies, and beer, also generate uric acid. This is why gout, a condition of excess uric acid, was so common among gluttonous aristocrats in the olden days (and still today). I test my patients‚Äô levels of uric acid, not only because high levels may promote fat storage but also because it is linked to high blood pressure. High uric acid is an early warning sign that we need to address a patient‚Äôs metabolic health, their diet, or both.

Yet because my calcium score was ‚Äúonly‚Äù 6, and my all-important LDL (‚Äúbad‚Äù) cholesterol was ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù the medical advice I received was‚Äîwait for it‚Äîto do nothing. Sound familiar?

<li>Eating lots of saturated fat <em>can</em> increase levels of atherosclerosis-causing lipoproteins in blood, but most of the actual cholesterol that we consume in our food ends up being excreted out our backsides. The vast majority of the cholesterol in our circulation is actually produced by our own cells. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hse9xf23g0wy7xtcjb9w2mb3">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>There‚Äôs no connection whatsoever between cholesterol in food and cholesterol in blood,‚Äù Keys said in a 1997 interview. ‚ÄúNone. And we‚Äôve known that all along.

<li>I‚Äôve been saying LDL, but the key factor here is actually <em>exposure</em> to apoB-tagged particles, over time. The more of these particles that you have in your circulation, not only LDL but VLDL and some others, the greater the risk that some of them will penetrate the endothelium and get stuck. Going back to our street analogy, imagine that we have, say, one ton of cholesterol moving down the street, divided among four pickup trucks. The chance of an accident is fairly small. But if that same total amount of cholesterol is being carried on five hundred of those little rental scooters that swarm around cities like Austin, where I live, we are going to have absolute mayhem<a href="">[*2]</a> on our hands. So to gauge the true extent of your risk, we <em>have</em> to know how many of these apoB particles are circulating in your bloodstream. That number is much more relevant than the total quantity of cholesterol that these particles are carrying.

<li>Calcification is merely another way in which the body is trying to repair the damage, by stabilizing the plaque to protect the all-important arteries.

<li>Together, our stories illustrate three blind spots of Medicine 2.0 when it comes to dealing with atherosclerotic disease: first, an overly simplistic view of lipids that fails to understand the importance of total lipoprotein burden (apoB) and how much one needs to reduce it in order to truly reduce risk; second, a general lack of knowledge about other bad actors such as Lp(a); and third, a failure to fully grasp the lengthy time course of atherosclerotic disease, and the implications this carries if we seek true prevention.

<li>Monounsaturated fats, found in high quantities in extra virgin olive oil, macadamia nuts, and avocados (among other foods), do not have this effect, so I tend to push my patients to consume more of these, up to about 60 percent of total fat intake. The point is not necessarily to limit fat overall but to shift to fats that promote a better lipid profile.

<li>The problem we face is that once cancer is established, we lack highly effective treatments for it. Our toolbox is limited. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsf3f4bhdhj1ns2s9v8dxmt6">View Highlight</a>)</li>

<li>Our first and most obvious wish is to avoid getting cancer at all, like the centenarians‚Äîin other words, prevention. But cancer prevention is tricky, because we do not yet fully understand what drives the initiation and progression of the disease with the same resolution that we have for atherosclerosis. Further, plain bad luck seems to play a major role in this largely stochastic process. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsf3h67036byfx63cxt36srx">View Highlight</a>)</li>

<li>While it‚Äôs tricky to impossible to avoid or prevent the genetic mutations that help give rise to cancer, it is relatively easy to address the metabolic factors that feed it. I‚Äôm not suggesting that it‚Äôs possible to ‚Äústarve‚Äù cancer or that any particular diet will magically make cancer go away; cancer cells always seem to be able to obtain the energy supply they need. What I am saying is that we don‚Äôt want to be anywhere on that spectrum of insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes, where our cancer risk is clearly elevated. To me, this is the low-hanging fruit of cancer prevention, right up there with quitting smoking. Getting our metabolic health in order is essential to our anticancer strategy. In the next section, we‚Äôll look at how metabolic interventions have also been used to potentiate other kinds of cancer therapy.

<li>the people who are still drinking in older age tend to do so <em>because</em> they are healthy, and not the other way around.

<li>The farther away we get from the SAD, the better off we will be. This is the common goal of most ‚Äúdiets‚Äù‚Äîto help us break free of the powerful gravitational pull of the SAD so that we can eat less, and hopefully eat better. But eating less is the primary aim. Once you strip away the labels and the ideology, almost all diets rely on at least one of the following three strategies to accomplish this:<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>CALORIC RESTRICTION, or CR: eating less in total, but without attention to what is being eaten or when it‚Äôs being eaten</li>
<li>DIETARY RESTRICTION, or DR: eating less of some particular element(s) within the diet (e.g., meat, sugar, fats)</li>
<li>TIME RESTRICTION, or TR: restricting eating to certain times, up to and including multiday fasting (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx2htnn3k2s5w5wk27td9fr">View Highlight</a>)</li>

<li>Taken together, then, what do these two monkey studies have to tell us about nutritional biochemistry?<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>Avoiding diabetes and related metabolic dysfunction‚Äîespecially by eliminating or reducing junk food‚Äîis very important to longevity.</li>
<li>There appears to be a strong link between calories and cancer, the leading cause of death in the control monkeys in both studies. The CR monkeys had a 50 percent lower incidence of cancer.</li>
<li>The <em>quality</em> of the food you eat could be as important as the <em>quantity.</em> If you‚Äôre eating the SAD, then you should eat much less of it.</li>
<li>Conversely, if your diet is high quality to begin with, and you are metabolically healthy, then only a slight degree of caloric restriction‚Äîor simply not eating to excess‚Äîcan still be beneficial.
I think this last point is key. These two studies suggest that if you are eating a higher-quality diet‚Äîand are metabolically healthy to begin with‚Äîthen severe caloric restriction may not even be necessary (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx3d5fvywvw3tny0nsgmqe7">View Highlight</a>)</li>

<li>At the time, this confused me. What was wrong with them? Why couldn‚Äôt they just follow the diet correctly? I had to remind myself of what Steve Rosenberg used to say when a patient‚Äôs cancer progressed despite treatment: <em>The patient has not failed the treatment; the treatment has failed the patient.</em>
These patients needed a different treatment.
The real art to dietary restriction, Nutrition 3.0‚Äìstyle, is not picking which evil foods we‚Äôre eliminating. Rather, it‚Äôs finding the best mix of macronutrients for our patient‚Äîcoming up with an eating pattern that helps them achieve their goals, in a way that they can sustain. This is a tricky balancing act, and it requires us (once again) to forget about labels and viewpoints and drill down into nutritional biochemistry. The way we do this is by manipulating our four macronutrients: alcohol, carbohydrates, protein, and fat. How well do you tolerate carbohydrates? How much protein do you require? What sorts of fats suit you best? How many calories do you require each day? What is the optimal combination <em>for you</em>? (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx53zckszncx8gy34vb671y">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>One thing CGM pretty quickly teaches you is that your carbohydrate tolerance is heavily influenced by other factors, especially your activity level and sleep. An ultraendurance athlete, someone who is training for long rides or swims or runs, can eat many more grams of carbs per day because they are blowing through those carbs every time they train‚Äîand they are also vastly increasing their ability to dispose of glucose via the muscles and their more-efficient mitochondria.<a href="">[*6]</a> Also, sleep disruption or reduction dramatically impairs glucose homeostasis over time. From years of experience with my own CGM and that of my patients, it still amazes me how much even one night of horrible sleep cripples our ability to dispose of glucose the next day.

<li>He was gaming his CGM, but he had also unwittingly discovered another rule of nutrition, which is that timing is important: If you scarf a large baked potato before working out, it will leave much less of a footprint on your daily glucose profile than if you eat it right before bedtime.

<li>The first thing you need to know about protein is that the standard recommendations for daily consumption are a joke. Right now the US recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 g/kg of body weight. This may reflect how much protein we need to stay alive, but it is a far cry from what we need to thrive. There is ample evidence showing that we require more than this‚Äîand that consuming less leads to worse outcomes. More than one study has found that elderly people consuming that RDA of protein (0.8 g/kg/day) end up <em>losing</em> muscle mass, even in as short a period as two weeks. It‚Äôs simply not enough. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx5mjpswsb800v886rm0x0k">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>How much protein do we actually need? It varies from person to person. In my patients I typically set 1.6 g/kg/day as the minimum, which is twice the RDA. The ideal amount can vary from person to person, but the data suggest that for active people with normal kidney function, one gram per <em>pound</em> of body weight per day (or 2.2 g/kg/day) is a good place to start‚Äînearly triple the minimal recommendation.

<li>For me and my patients, this works out to four servings, as described, with at least one of them being a whey protein shake. (It‚Äôs very difficult for me to consume four actual meals.

<li>In the final analysis, I tell my patients that on the basis of the least bad, least ambiguous data available, MUFAs are probably the fat that should make up most of our dietary fat mix, which means extra virgin olive oil and high-MUFA vegetable oils. After that, it‚Äôs kind of a toss-up, and the actual ratio of SFA and PUFA probably comes down to individual factors such as lipid response and measured inflammation. Finally, unless they are eating a lot of fatty fish, filling their coffers with marine omega-3 PUFA, they almost always need to take EPA and DHA supplements in capsule or oil form.

<li>This study gave birth to the eight-hour diet fad, but somehow people lost sight of the fact that this is a big extrapolation from research <em>in mice.</em> Because a mouse lives for only about two to three years‚Äîand will die after just forty-eight hours without food‚Äîa sixteen-hour fast for a mouse is akin to a multiday fast for a human.

<li>As a result of this and other research, I have become convinced that frequent, prolonged fasting may be neither necessary nor wise for most patients. The cost, in terms of lost lean mass (muscle) and reduced activity levels, simply does not justify whatever benefits it may bring. My rule of thumb for any eating pattern, in fact, is that you <em>must</em> eat enough to maintain lean mass (muscle) and long-term activity patterns. That is part of what makes any diet sustainable. If we are going to use a powerful tool like fasting, we must do so carefully and deliberately. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx6kvrhtm0nhj7qd6d12njv">View Highlight</a>)</li>

<li>Most important, you must create an environment for yourself that is conducive to sleeping well. The first requirement for good sleep is darkness. Light is the enemy of sleep, full stop. Thus, you want to make your bedroom itself as dark as possible‚Äîinstalling room-darkening curtains if you live somewhere with a lot of outdoor evening light, and removing all light sources in the bedroom, even down to electronic equipment like TVs and cable boxes and such. Their little pinpoint LEDs are more than bright enough to keep you from sleeping well. Digital clocks are especially deadly, not only because of their bright numerals but also because if you wake up and see that it‚Äôs 3:31¬†a.m., you might start worrying about your 7 a.m. flight and never fall back asleep.

<li>One large-scale survey found that the more interactive devices subjects used during the hour before bedtime, the more difficulties they had falling asleep and staying asleep‚Äîwhereas passive devices such as TV, electronic music players, and, best of all, books were less likely to be associated with poor sleep. This may partially explain why watching TV before bed does not seem to affect sleep quite as negatively as playing video games or scrolling social media does, according to research by Michael Gradisar, a sleep researcher and professor of psychology at Flinders University in Australia.

<li>I am increasingly persuaded that our 24-7 addiction to screens and social media is perhaps our most destructive habit, not only to our ability to sleep but to our mental health in general.

<li>To help that happen, try to keep your bedroom cool‚Äîaround sixty-five degrees Fahrenheit seems to be optimal.

<li>This type of suffering is far more prevalent than suicide rates would suggest.

Nothing else about longevity is really worth much without some degree of happiness, fulfillment, and connection to others.

<li>Trauma generally falls into five categories: (1) abuse (physical or sexual, but also emotional or spiritual); (2) neglect; (3) abandonment; (4) enmeshment (the blurring of boundaries between adults and children); and (5) witnessing tragic events. Most of the things that wound children fit into these five categories. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv20h1rjay96ypra4jybv0j4">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>The most important thing about childhood trauma is not the event itself but the way the child adapts to it. Children are remarkably resilient, and wounded children become adaptive children. The problems begin when these adaptive children grow up to become maladaptive, dysfunctional adults. This dysfunction is represented by the four branches of the trauma tree: (1) addiction, not only to vices such as drugs, alcohol, and gambling, but also to socially acceptable things such as work, exercise, and perfectionism (check); (2) codependency, or excessive psychological reliance on another person; (3) habituated survival strategies, such as a propensity to anger and rage (check); (4) attachment disorders, difficulty forming and maintaining connections or meaningful relationships with others (check). These branches are often fairly obvious and easy to spot; the tricky part is digging down to the roots and beginning to disentangle them. All of this is highly individual; everyone responds and adapts to trauma in a unique way. And it‚Äôs not as if there is some sort of pill that can make someone‚Äôs trauma, or their adaptations to it, simply go away. It requires hard work‚Äîand, as I would come to understand, it can also take a very long time. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv20qjaqwjtyp6rhv4xqjv42">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>Here, we are more interested in <em>emotional health,</em> which incorporates mental health but is also much broader‚Äîand less easy to codify and categorize. Emotional health has more to do with the way we regulate our emotions and manage our interpersonal relationships. I did not have a mental <em>illness,</em> per se, but I did have serious issues with my emotional health that impaired my ability to live a happy, well-adjusted life‚Äîand potentially did put my life in danger.

Once I started, I could not put it down. It was almost creepy that this guy seemed to be writing <em>about me,</em> despite never having met me. His main thesis is that with women, depression is generally overt, or obvious, but men are socialized to conceal their depression, channeling it inward or into other emotions, such as anger, without ever wanting to discuss it. (Hence the title.) I could relate to the stories that he shared about his patients. So I began to work with Terry as well.

<li>One skill I worked on that is a bit more complicated is called ‚Äúreframing.‚Äù Reframing is basically the ability to look at a given situation from someone else‚Äôs point of view‚Äîliterally reframing it (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv21ay9fzstxw8s0bm56f40j">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>This comes in handy almost every single day. For example, if my wife comes home and snips at me because I didn‚Äôt help put away the groceries, my tendency might be to think, <em>Hey, I‚Äôm working really hard and I can‚Äôt always pitch in</em>. And that sense of entitlement would sneak up inside me because, well, I am working very hard, and someone else can put away the groceries.
But then I ask myself, <em>Wait, what has Jill‚Äôs day been like today?</em>
She had to pick up our boys from school and take them to the grocery store, where they probably fought like wild animals and made everyone in the store think Jill is the worst mother on the planet because she can‚Äôt control her spoiled little brats, while she stood in line at the deli counter just to get me the perfectly sliced deli meat that can‚Äôt be found with the prepackaged deli meat, and then on the way home she hit every single red light while the boys threw Lego bricks at each other.
And you know what? When I view it through her lens, I quickly get over myself and realize that I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs being selfish and that next time I have to do better. That‚Äôs the power of reframing. You realize that you have to step back from a situation, temper your reflexive reaction, and try to see what is actually happening.

<li>DBT teaches a variety of techniques to enable people to maintain and improve their distress tolerance, and to recognize and cope with their emotions‚Äîand not be controlled <em>by</em> them, as I had been for so long. One simple tactic that I use to cope with mounting emotional distress is inducing an abrupt sensory change‚Äîtypically, by throwing ice water on my face or, if I‚Äôm really struggling, taking a cold shower or stepping into an ice bath. This simple intervention stimulates an important cranial nerve, the vagus nerve, which causes our heart rate and respiratory rate to slow and switches us into a calm, parasympathetic mode (and out of our fight-or-flight sympathetic mode). Interventions like these are often enough to help refocus and think about a situation more calmly and constructively. Another technique I have grown very fond of is slow, deep breathing: four seconds to inhale, six seconds to exhale. Repeat. As the breath goes, the nervous system follows. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv4dstv5xvmdfmw7hjn4c9c5">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>It is also important to note that DBT is not a passive modality. It requires conscious thought and action on a daily basis. One tactic that I‚Äôve found especially helpful is called *opposite action‚Äî*that is, if I feel like doing one thing (generally, not a helpful or positive thing), I‚Äôll force myself instead to do the exact opposite.

<li>The most important ‚Äútactic‚Äù by far is my regular weekly therapy session (down from three or four per week when I left PCS). This is not optional. Each session begins with a physical check-in: How am I feeling? How have I slept (a big one)? Am I in physical pain? Am I in conflict? Then we dissect and discuss the events and issues of the week in minute detail. No topic is too insignificant. If, for example, I found myself getting really upset at a TV show or movie, this might be worth exploring. But we also tackle big-picture issues, the ones that propelled me into crisis in the first place. I complement my therapy sessions by writing in my journal, a place where I can practice articulating my emotions and understanding them, holding nothing back.

The focus shifts from delaying disease to maintaining physical and mental functions for a longer, healthier life. The text emphasizes the importance of addressing metabolic health to lower risks and prevent chronic diseases. It advocates for a holistic approach involving exercise, nutrition, emotional health, and cognitive function to improve healthspan and potentially extend lifespan. The narrative explores various interventions, such as exercise and metabolic health management, to promote longevity and overall well-being.\n\n#NotesL1\n\n## Highlights\n- In the dream, I‚Äôm trying to catch the falling eggs.

The reality was that nearly all these patients would still die within a few years. The egg would inevitably hit the ground. What were we really accomplishing? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrjgw8hbghd9t8psdyb2f58c))\n- The reason why goes back to my dream about the falling eggs. In short, it had finally dawned on me that the only way to solve the problem was not to get better at catching the eggs. Instead, we needed to try to stop the guy who was throwing them. We had to figure out how to get to the top of the building, find the guy, and take him out.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrjp9nt0jbfjtvefac25jrmd))\n    - Note: Good way of thinking!\n- Each one of the Horsemen is cumulative, the product of multiple risk factors adding up and compounding over time. Many of these same individual risk factors, it turns out, are relatively easy to reduce or even eliminate. Even better, they share certain features or drivers in common that make them vulnerable to some of the same tactics and behavioral changes we will discuss in this book ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrq8canhjfe80zcsy7eqepyr))\n- This is how I see my role: I am not a laboratory scientist or clinical researcher but more of a translator, helping you understand and apply these insights. This requires a thorough understanding of the science but also a bit of art, just as if we were translating a poem by Shakespeare into another language. We have to get the meaning of the words exactly right (the science), while also capturing the tone, the nuance, the feeling, and the rhythm (the art). Similarly, my approach to longevity is firmly rooted in science, but there is also a good deal of art in figuring out how and when to apply our knowledge to you, the patient, with your specific genes, your history and habits, and your goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrq8j173as7pqt79am8yfh59))\n    - Note: This will be my role as well, a translator.\n      Using layman's terms to describe what you should or should not do on certain topics.\n- My goal is to create an actionable operating manual for the *practice* of longevity. A guide that will help you Outlive. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrq8n4wth5j5k2bpa0std0za))\n    - Note: Maybe my channel can be named \"outsmart\". You can't be the smartest bunny in the world but if you can outsmart 95% of people, it's probably good enough.\n- But my intent here is not to tell you exactly *what to do;* it‚Äôs to help you learn *how to think* about doing these things*.* For me, that has been the journey, an obsessive process of study and iteration that began that day on the rocky shore of Catalina Island.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrqahbsy4xcwdb4y65yjzwbq))\n- The next step is crucial: rigorously testing that hypothesis/guess to determine whether it is correct, also known as experimenting. Instead of using treatments that they *believed* might work, often despite ample anecdotal evidence to the contrary, scientists and physicians could systematically test and evaluate potential cures, then choose the ones that had performed best in experiments. Yet three centuries elapsed between Bacon‚Äôs essay and the discovery of penicillin, the true game-changer of Medicine 2.0.

But nobody seemed to care that the *absolute* risk increase of breast cancer for women in¬†the study remained minuscule ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrra9x2bt0q5kvm5z70ak37t))\n    - Note: Numbers can lie. Relative % without absolute value means nothing.\n- The fourth and perhaps largest shift is that where Medicine 2.0 focuses largely on lifespan, and is almost entirely geared toward staving off death, *Medicine 3.0 pays far more attention to maintaining healthspan, the quality of life.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrrawcw6gs4y1d28y0bp8hjk))\n- Beginning in her early seventies, Sophie had undergone a steep physical decline that began when she slipped and fell while gardening, tearing a muscle in her shoulder. That soon escalated into back and neck pain so severe that she could no longer work in the garden or play golf at all, her two primary passions in retirement. She simply sat around the house, feeling depressed. This was followed by a descent into dementia in the last couple of years of her life, before she died of a respiratory infection at age eighty-three. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrrb9rhv3kxn14cm5refmxt2))\n    - Note: It's always like that.\n      An \"accident\" followed by the deprivation of hobbies.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrrbv74jqn31k4jtjc0fntnn))\n- strategy, and the science that informs it, our tactics will not mean much, and you‚Äôll forever ride the merry-go-round of fad diets and trendy workouts and miracle supplements.

Our tactics in Medicine 3.0 fall into five broad domains: exercise, nutrition, sleep, emotional health, and exogenous molecules, meaning drugs, hormones, or supplements. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrrcedsbt7vjsgv3vrrmkzjy))\n- We‚Äôre trying to attack heart disease, cancer, stroke, and Alzheimer‚Äôs one disease at a time, as if somehow these diseases are all unrelated to each other, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrtt58jckb1kh6w49t4zfqmv))\n- Why do we care about mTOR? Because this mechanism turns out to be one of the most important mediators of longevity at the cellular level. Not only that, but it is highly ‚Äúconserved,‚Äù meaning it is found in virtually all forms of life, ranging from yeast to flies to worms and right on up to us humans. In biology, ‚Äúconserved‚Äù means that something has been passed on via natural selection, across multiple species and classes of organisms‚Äîa sign that evolution has deemed it to be very important. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrtx9jtpcvgh5bqjjesz34yx))\n- The job of mTOR is basically to balance an organism‚Äôs need to grow and reproduce against the availability of nutrients. When food is plentiful, mTOR is activated and the cell (or the organism) goes into growth mode, producing new proteins and undergoing cell division, as with the ultimate goal of reproduction. When nutrients are scarce, mTOR is suppressed and cells go into a kind of ‚Äúrecycling‚Äù mode, breaking down cellular components and generally cleaning house. Cell division and growth slow down or stop, and reproduction is put on hold to allow the organism to conserve energy.

Today we call this cluster of problems ‚Äúmetabolic syndrome‚Äù (or MetSyn), and it is defined in terms of the following five criteria:\n  1. high blood pressure (\u003e130/85)\n  2. high triglycerides (\u003e150 mg/dL)\n  3. low HDL cholesterol (\u003c40 mg/dL in men or \u003c50 mg/dL in women)\n  4. central adiposity (waist circumference \u003e40 inches in men or \u003e35 in women)\n  5. elevated fasting glucose (\u003e110 mg/dL) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrw2xcds4q03xbqfybp84t12))\n- ![](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/media/reader/parsed_document_assets/149960301/W5XA_gYjTdc2RDkWGBysnnuR3tcGyxtqzsj_q6C1Nl8-img1_zfuQPx4.jpg) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrw2yx46n68737xt4ztpthe9))\n- About 75¬†percent of this glycogen ends up in skeletal muscle and the other 25¬†percent goes to the liver, although this ratio can vary. An adult male can typically store a total of about 1,600 calories worth of glycogen between these two sites, or about enough energy for two hours of vigorous endurance exercise. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrw33nm4a9ks3v6pxjbxx4bf))\n- Consider that five grams of glucose, spread out across one‚Äôs entire circulatory system, is normal, while seven grams‚Äîa teaspoon and a half‚Äîmeans you have diabetes.

If you keep the faucet running even after the tub is full and the drain is closed (i.e., you‚Äôre sedentary), water begins spilling over the rim of the tub, flowing into places where it‚Äôs not wanted or needed, like onto the bathroom floor, into the heating vents or down the stairs.

This is a generalization, but people of Asian descent (for example), tend to have much lower capacity to store fat, on average, than Caucasians. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrw6687p38tpv24bk1yb5x7f))\n- This is why I insist my patients undergo a DEXA scan annually‚Äîand I am far more interested in their visceral fat than their total body fat ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrw67e4t25hfzb6kqk9k30ry))\n- Fructose isn‚Äôt the only thing that creates uric acid; foods high in chemicals called purines, such as certain meats, cheeses, anchovies, and beer, also generate uric acid. This is why gout, a condition of excess uric acid, was so common among gluttonous aristocrats in the olden days (and still today). I test my patients‚Äô levels of uric acid, not only because high levels may promote fat storage but also because it is linked to high blood pressure. High uric acid is an early warning sign that we need to address a patient‚Äôs metabolic health, their diet, or both.

Yet because my calcium score was ‚Äúonly‚Äù 6, and my all-important LDL (‚Äúbad‚Äù) cholesterol was ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù the medical advice I received was‚Äîwait for it‚Äîto do nothing. Sound familiar? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsamqngevb1p5a8s93b073p8))\n    - Note: \"normal\" means very little\n- Eating lots of saturated fat *can* increase levels of atherosclerosis-causing lipoproteins in blood, but most of the actual cholesterol that we consume in our food ends up being excreted out our backsides. The vast majority of the cholesterol in our circulation is actually produced by our own cells. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hse9xf23g0wy7xtcjb9w2mb3))\n- There‚Äôs no connection whatsoever between cholesterol in food and cholesterol in blood,‚Äù Keys said in a 1997 interview. ‚ÄúNone. And we‚Äôve known that all along. Cholesterol in the diet doesn‚Äôt matter at all unless you happen to be a chicken or a rabbit.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsea4pmfw77qm7rx2cqfkb7w))\n- I‚Äôve been saying LDL, but the key factor here is actually *exposure* to apoB-tagged particles, over time. The more of these particles that you have in your circulation, not only LDL but VLDL and some others, the greater the risk that some of them will penetrate the endothelium and get stuck. Going back to our street analogy, imagine that we have, say, one ton of cholesterol moving down the street, divided among four pickup trucks. The chance of an accident is fairly small. But if that same total amount of cholesterol is being carried on five hundred of those little rental scooters that swarm around cities like Austin, where I live, we are going to have absolute mayhem[[*2]](private://read/01hrg4kkxd33y02jjdkacx417q/#_footnote_d1-000c1f45) on our hands. So to gauge the true extent of your risk, we *have* to know how many of these apoB particles are circulating in your bloodstream. That number is much more relevant than the total quantity of cholesterol that these particles are carrying.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsejt4km37b70f6tcnnx4x3b))\n- When I look at a patient‚Äôs blood panel for the first time, my eyes immediately dart to two numbers: apoB and Lp(a) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsf29d1k2a9r53zm17c57nb6))\n- Monounsaturated fats, found in high quantities in extra virgin olive oil, macadamia nuts, and avocados (among other foods), do not have this effect, so I tend to push my patients to consume more of these, up to about 60 percent of total fat intake. The point is not necessarily to limit fat overall but to shift to fats that promote a better lipid profile. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsf2k386w84p5xjzxhcgb1rw))\n- The problem we face is that once cancer is established, we lack highly effective treatments for it. Our toolbox is limited. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsf3f4bhdhj1ns2s9v8dxmt6))\n- The second problem is that our ability to detect cancer at an early stage remains very weak. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsf3fcchd7m1xvmvjk1s0je6))\n- Our first and most obvious wish is to avoid getting cancer at all, like the centenarians‚Äîin other words, prevention. But cancer prevention is tricky, because we do not yet fully understand what drives the initiation and progression of the disease with the same resolution that we have for atherosclerosis. Further, plain bad luck seems to play a major role in this largely stochastic process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsf3h67036byfx63cxt36srx))\n- Next is the use of newer and smarter treatments targeting cancer‚Äôs manifold weaknesses ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsf3hkmdd2ddqs6attz2ep8q))\n- Third, and perhaps most importantly, we need to try to detect cancer as early as possible so that our treatments can be deployed more effectively. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsf3hqq66dq1h7gzt69ydbwb))\n- If two women have breast cancer, at the same stage, their tumor genomes are likely to be very different from each other. Therefore, it would be difficult if not impossible to devise one treatment for both women based on the genetic profile of their tumors. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsf4yn46e3njzxmhnef2a4f3))\n    - Note: No wonder this war takes so long!\n- Even when we treat a local cancer successfully, we can never be sure that it‚Äôs entirely gone. We have no way of knowing whether cancer cells may have already spread and are lurking in other organs, waiting to establish a foothold there. It is this metastatic cancer that is responsible for most cancer deaths. If we want to reduce cancer mortality by a significant amount, we must do a better job of preventing, detecting, and treating metastatic cancers.

But many important noncancerous cells are also dividing frequently, such as those in the lining of the mouth and gut, the hair follicles, and the nails, which is why typical chemotherapy agents cause side effects like hair loss and gastrointestinal misery. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsf58mmaycqt2qnhjrpajv1q))\n- those cancer cells that do manage to survive chemotherapy often end up acquiring mutations that make them stronger ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsf5982p6vt5wn5pxwqf2h0z))\n- even today, one way to locate potential tumors is by injecting the patient with radioactively labeled glucose and then doing a PET scan to see where most of the glucose is migrating.

I‚Äôm not suggesting that it‚Äôs possible to ‚Äústarve‚Äù cancer or that any particular diet will magically make cancer go away; cancer cells always seem to be able to obtain the energy supply they need. What I am saying is that we don‚Äôt want to be anywhere on that spectrum of insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes, where our cancer risk is clearly elevated. To me, this is the low-hanging fruit of cancer prevention, right up there with quitting smoking. Getting our metabolic health in order is essential to our anticancer strategy. In the next section, we‚Äôll look at how metabolic interventions have also been used to potentiate other kinds of cancer therapy.

But when patients do respond to immunotherapy, and go into complete remission, they often *stay* in remission.

There is a financial cost, of course, but there is also an emotional cost, particularly of tests that may generate false positives. And there are other, incidental risks, such as the slight risk from a colonoscopy or the more significant risk from an unnecessary biopsy. These three costs must be weighed against the cost of missing a cancer, or not spotting it early, when it is still susceptible to treatment.

Our goal is to improve glucose metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress. One possible recommendation for someone like her would be to switch to a Mediterranean-style diet, relying on more monounsaturated fats and fewer refined carbohydrates, in addition to regular consumption of fatty fish. There is some evidence that supplementation with the omega-3 fatty acid DHA, found in fish oil, may help maintain brain health, especially in *e4/e4* carriers.

This is a tricky balancing act, and it requires us (once again) to forget about labels and viewpoints and drill down into nutritional biochemistry.

There is ample evidence showing that we require more than this‚Äîand that consuming less leads to worse outcomes.

This may partially explain why watching TV before bed does not seem to affect sleep quite as negatively as playing video games or scrolling social media does, according to research by Michael Gradisar, a sleep researcher and professor of psychology at Flinders University in Australia.

A warm bath before bed may actually help with this process, not only because the bath itself is relaxing but also because when we get out of the bath and climb into our cool bed, our core temperature drops, which signals to our brain that it is time to fall asleep ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx9j4x64vmam04yyj0zasvt))\n- Don‚Äôt eat anything less than three hours before bedtime‚Äîand ideally longer.

It simply robs you of the joy that enables you to focus on your health, life, and relationships with others, so that instead of living, you are merely waiting to die. This is why I‚Äôve come to believe that emotional health may represent the most important component of healthspan. Nothing else about longevity is really worth much without some degree of happiness, fulfillment, and connection to others. And misery and unhappiness can also destroy your physical health, just as surely as cancer, heart disease, neurodegenerative disease, and orthopedic injury.

Most of the things that wound children fit into these five categories. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv20h1rjay96ypra4jybv0j4))\n- The most important thing about childhood trauma is not the event itself but the way the child adapts to it. Children are remarkably resilient, and wounded children become adaptive children. The problems begin when these adaptive children grow up to become maladaptive, dysfunctional adults. This dysfunction is represented by the four branches of the trauma tree: (1) addiction, not only to vices such as drugs, alcohol, and gambling, but also to socially acceptable things such as work, exercise, and perfectionism (check); (2) codependency, or excessive psychological reliance on another person; (3) habituated survival strategies, such as a propensity to anger and rage (check); (4) attachment disorders, difficulty forming and maintaining connections or meaningful relationships with others (check). These branches are often fairly obvious and easy to spot; the tricky part is digging down to the roots and beginning to disentangle them. All of this is highly individual; everyone responds and adapts to trauma in a unique way. And it‚Äôs not as if there is some sort of pill that can make someone‚Äôs trauma, or their adaptations to it, simply go away. It requires hard work‚Äîand, as I would come to understand, it can also take a very long time.

Emotional health has more to do with the way we regulate our emotions and manage our interpersonal relationships. I did not have a mental *illness,* per se, but I did have serious issues with my emotional health that impaired my ability to live a happy, well-adjusted life‚Äîand potentially did put my life in danger. Medicine 2.0 has a harder time dealing with situations such as this.

Once I started, I could not put it down. It was almost creepy that this guy seemed to be writing *about me,* despite never having met me. His main thesis is that with women, depression is generally overt, or obvious, but men are socialized to conceal their depression, channeling it inward or into other emotions, such as anger, without ever wanting to discuss it. (Hence the title.) I could relate to the stories that he shared about his patients. So I began to work with Terry as well. After having gone far too long without any therapy at all, I was now seeing three therapists.

If they see me screaming at a driver who just cut me off, they internalize that rage as though it were directed to them. Second, trauma is generational, although not necessarily linear. Children of alcoholics are not inevitably destined to become alcoholics themselves, but one way or another, trauma finds its way down the line.

For example, if my wife comes home and snips at me because I didn‚Äôt help put away the groceries, my tendency might be to think, *Hey, I‚Äôm working really hard and I can‚Äôt always pitch in*. And that sense of entitlement would sneak up inside me because, well, I am working very hard, and someone else can put away the groceries.\n  But then I ask myself, *Wait, what has Jill‚Äôs day been like today?*\n  She had to pick up our boys from school and take them to the grocery store, where they probably fought like wild animals and made everyone in the store think Jill is the worst mother on the planet because she can‚Äôt control her spoiled little brats, while she stood in line at the deli counter just to get me the perfectly sliced deli meat that can‚Äôt be found with the prepackaged deli meat, and then on the way home she hit every single red light while the boys threw Lego bricks at each other.\n  And you know what? When I view it through her lens, I quickly get over myself and realize that I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs being selfish and that next time I have to do better. That‚Äôs the power of reframing. You realize that you have to step back from a situation, temper your reflexive reaction, and try to see what is actually happening.

One simple tactic that I use to cope with mounting emotional distress is inducing an abrupt sensory change‚Äîtypically, by throwing ice water on my face or, if I‚Äôm really struggling, taking a cold shower or stepping into an ice bath. This simple intervention stimulates an important cranial nerve, the vagus nerve, which causes our heart rate and respiratory rate to slow and switches us into a calm, parasympathetic mode (and out of our fight-or-flight sympathetic mode). Interventions like these are often enough to help refocus and think about a situation more calmly and constructively. Another technique I have grown very fond of is slow, deep breathing: four seconds to inhale, six seconds to exhale. Repeat. As the breath goes, the nervous system follows. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv4dstv5xvmdfmw7hjn4c9c5))\n- It is also important to note that DBT is not a passive modality. It requires conscious thought and action on a daily basis. One tactic that I‚Äôve found especially helpful is called *opposite action‚Äî*that is, if I feel like doing one thing (generally, not a helpful or positive thing), I‚Äôll force myself instead to do the exact opposite. By doing so, I also change the underlying emotions.

This is not optional. Each session begins with a physical check-in: How am I feeling? How have I slept (a big one)? Am I in physical pain? Am I in conflict? Then we dissect and discuss the events and issues of the week in minute detail. No topic is too insignificant. If, for example, I found myself getting really upset at a TV show or movie, this might be worth exploring. But we also tackle big-picture issues, the ones that propelled me into crisis in the first place. I complement my therapy sessions by writing in my journal, a place where I can practice articulating my emotions and understanding them, holding nothing back. I feel strongly that there is no substitute for this kind of work with a trained therapist.

For as long as I could remember, I believed that I was defective and that my flaws were hard-wired. Unchangeable.
