<li>Full Title: A Manual for Being Human</li>
<li>Category: #books</li>
<li>Summary: The text discusses coping skills, emotional experiences, and self-understanding in navigating life&#x27;s challenges. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing and expressing emotions, seeking connection with others, and developing resilience through shared experiences. Additionally, it touches on the impact of therapy in gaining insight and navigating patterns of behavior for personal growth.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>For example, do you want to understand how your childhood affects who you are today? How it affects your relationship with yourself and others? Do you wonder why there are experiences from that time that you feel you should be over but don’t quite seem to be able to let go of? If so, you’ll find the explanation here. Do you wonder how social media, marketing and the advertorial content you consume each day affects your emotional wellbeing? Do you want to know what your emotions actually are, where they come from and how to manage them when they threaten to overwhelm you? I will give you useful advice for how to have a healthier relationship with these facets of life. Do you want to believe in yourself and your ability to be content with who you are? If the answer is yes, then it’s all in here. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw86y205mv3j5re0fqcctkzc">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>Emotions, relationships and negative self-beliefs – the three main topics that bring people to therapy (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw87gt4dgdspt3a5xq9g9fwt">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>two biggest influences that shape who we are and what each of us struggle with: the environment we grew up in and the life events we have experienced (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw87hx4dt5za1b1tjnahnwd1">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>first memories tend to date back to three and a half years old, whatever happened then is likely still affecting you now – affecting how strongly you feel your emotions, whether you understand them, how you understand and interact with other humans, and who you choose to date and befriend (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw8a8gc4khfkqtx3dr8td8w3">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>The child learns: when adults snap it is because they are angry. This can happen when they’re busy. Adults can apologise when things go wrong and they have ways to manage their emotions, which I can try. And importantly, it was not my fault. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw8aev0navtyg31r0qq1w4g4">View Highlight</a>)<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Note: Children learn different feelings from caregivers. They feel safer and more assured alongside the way. It is absolutely fine to have those feelings but we (the child and the caregivers together) will sort it out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Whatever the reasons, some of us learned early on that adults couldn’t be there for us consistently, that they weren’t always reliable. More than that, we may have learned that connection with others can feel dangerous and that the world is emotionally fraught because of this. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw8bs558b5n77760aqtg1dzk">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>You may notice that you sometimes feel a little superior to others, seeing another’s ‘neediness’ and emotionality as something unnecessary and something you are relieved you don’t have. This isn’t because you’re arrogant or overly confident. Quite the opposite. This is your mind’s attempt at keeping you safe and your self-esteem up. It protects you from your (maybe unconscious) fear that you may not be someone another person is able to, or would want to, be there for. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw91mge8y6q9v4y3gpqhc5rd">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>Children who are not listened to, or who have found that neither people-pleasing or perfection helps in any way, may learn that the only way they get the attention they need is by getting angry and/or shouting louder, escalating their behaviours until they have broken enough rules that someone comes to stop them. This is something caregivers rarely understand. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw947m21m3n4h43j79nznkvm">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>We spend most of our lives repeating the patterns we adopted when young. The ones we adopted to keep ourselves safe and to stay close to the adult(s) that raised us. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw9embq49g7n4r8s4m525gb8">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>The golden child – this one sounds great, as it means you are the ‘hero’ of the family, with a deep sense of responsibility, but, if you mess up, it’s a disaster. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw9er081exrwn57phw6bw0np">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>I believe that one of the reasons many of us struggle in life is because we haven’t been given the right information to help us understand ourselves and to know that we are okay. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw9frad0a1n4regajgwtcyb0">View Highlight</a>)<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Note: The DAO we have been following since childhood might be outright flawed but we still choose to believe, as they were told by the people we trust and love.
For example, I&#x27;m very uncomfortable with debt because grandma told me debt is bad and miserable.
Grandpa believes 万般皆下品，惟有读书高 so I usually look down upon people not from top universities/grad schools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, male body issues are on the rise too, with research showing that increased exposure to images of muscular male bodies directly links to decreased mood and higher levels of physical dissatisfaction in countries where muscles are the gold standard of male beauty. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw9jph8yr51s26371vr3qrg6">View Highlight</a>)<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Note: Slightly disagree here.
Fat-phobia is bad if it promotes hatred towards overweighted people, but there&#x27;s nothing wrong to appreciate a well-built body.
Muscular male bodies might not be necessary but to live a long and healthy life people (not only men) should build enough muscles.
(I know what the author is trying to say here though - excessive body shaming is bad and you don&#x27;t need crazy muscles to be healthy!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>• How we believe we measure up to the images we are shown. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw9k4qtbh4hgcy4wm1zkwjgy">View Highlight</a>)<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Note: Porn is REALLY BAD in that regard. Most would think his dick is too small/he can&#x27;t last long enough, or her tits are not big enough.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If we feel we are doing better than others (this is called downward comparison), we will feel a boost and our self-esteem will go up. If we feel we aren’t doing as well (upward comparison), but feel that with a little practice or effort we could achieve that level, we may feel inspired.
If we see a large discrepancy, we may feel inadequate, defeated and lose motivation. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw9k81e6kp7d5hcceqvxfy87">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>Use social comparison to your advantage. If you need motivation, look to people who are doing slightly better than you, who you feel you could aspire to. If you need a boost, look at the people you feel are equal to you and are impressed by (it’s always easier to be proud of someone else’s success than our own), people who are behind you on your journey – perhaps a rung lower on your career ladder – so you can be reminded of how far you’ve come. Or maybe compare yourself to yesterday’s self. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw9m4xa4s8sdjgmrjzwe7bc7">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>Our brain uses short cuts to make sense of the world. One of these is social proof, the idea that if other people like something it must be good, and if lots of people follow someone they must be right. These short cuts can have us idolising people with huge followings, taking their words and ideas as gospel, wanting to buy anything they are selling, whether what they are selling works for us or not. They can stop us questioning what is right and true. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw9maqpfc5ecrchx10wz32ra">View Highlight</a>)<!-- -->

<li>Note: Business is always about profit.</li>

<li>Seeing men express emotions and receive support is even more rare in the media. There are so few options for them to see themselves thriving as someone who struggles or feels. This, coupled with the way we socialise men and boys to be strong and not cry, means men learn that they must not feel or ask for help.
Training men not to feel is killing them. In the UK, men are three times more likely to die by suicide than women; in Northern Ireland the number rises to four times more likely, and this is the same in the USA. To the men reading this: <em>you are allowed to feel, cry AND ask for help</em>.<!-- -->

<p>Crying releases stress hormones and increases endorphins. Crying is an act of self-care. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw9qdx18a9488c3syj5w5z3y">View Highlight</a>)</p>

<li>You know slot machines? Bright flashing lights? Most of the time you lose, but, on occasion, just as you’re about to give up, you win? People get hooked on them because of the addictive properties of the intermittent win – this is why we get hooked on our phones and on our social media, hungry for the likes that we cannot be sure will come. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwbdztvvdg39qvvns2f1az5a">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>Few people realise emotions have a purpose.
Emotions create the energy inside us that we need in order to turn towards the things that keep us alive and avoid the things that might kill us. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwbjwamz96eegh9jddw7p7hp">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>To stay safe, our ancestors didn’t wait until a tiger was at their door, the food was gone or they found themselves out in the cold before they reacted to the threats. That could be a lethal mistake. Instead, their brains developed to predict what would happen next, anticipating threats and rewards before they could occur, mounting a physical response that would ensure their survival. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwbk34wkbkeqvq1w34qa3p12">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>Anyone who has experienced this last one knows how powerful the prediction of danger linked to no phone can be, and how the prediction is almost always wrong. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwbm650hemdt246b258b9t0t">View Highlight</a>)<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Note: Same thing for FOMO. I won&#x27;t get shit but still. It&#x27;s all in my head!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The point is:
• We do not experience the world exactly as it is.
• We experience it based on the predictions we make.
• Our predictions are based on our personal history.
• The predictions we make cause simulations, which cause physical responses, and we call these emotions.
• Our predictions are not always accurate and are sometimes exaggerated.
• Our brain will update the information it uses to make predictions when we gain new information (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwbmg2bxekztmakf1cans4jv">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>Shame is accompanied by the thought ‘I am bad’, while guilt says, ‘I did something bad’.
I believe shame is far less useful than guilt. Shame makes us see the world the way as young children, who cannot hold good and bad in their mind at the same time. It makes us believe that one single moment in our life defines us, which is not the case. It can totally paralyse us.

<li>Note: Mom&#x27;s trip to Cuba - no message from her in over 24 hours. Turns out there&#x27;s no WiFi in her room and the esim doesn&#x27;t work.
Also, the discussion I&#x27;m about to have with Robin that I&#x27;m selling the condo and he has to move. Im afraid he&#x27;s gonna make a big fuss about it.
Shelly’s parents are coming to visit soon. Given that the previous meetups were BAD, I am very anxious about it.</li>

<li>Note: The travel document incident. They rejected my request but in the end it&#x27;s really not that big of a deal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When a worrying thought or anger arises, do as author Brené Brown does: ask yourself, ‘What is the story I’m telling myself right now?’ For example, ‘The story I’m telling myself right now is that this “We need to speak” email is the end of my career, this text the end of my relationship’, or ‘The wild night out and my bad behaviour is the end of my social life’. Remind yourself that this is a prediction. Then check for the evidence. What is the evidence for this fear? What is the evidence against it? If the worst outcome did happen, what is the evidence you would survive it? You can even check out your ‘stories’ with your friends. What evidence do they see that confirms your fears or goes against them? When we are stressed or worried it colours everything we see. It shapes our predictions. Friends who do not feel stressed may be able to offer different evidence. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwbn0dxwbs5fgcpqzba904tn">View Highlight</a>)<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Note: Bayes theorem.
Using Robin as an example. He’s a religious white man, with reasonable income and on his own. From a tenant perspective I’d give him a solid 7/10 (above average).
Let’s assume in Toronto landlords have a 5% chance to run into issues when trying to sell. I’d like to evaluate P[Issue | Robin]. For the sake of example I’m exaggerating P[Robin | Issue] as 0.3 (30% of these troublesome tenants fit that description), and P[Robin | no Issue] as 0.1 (10% of the renters are just like Robin).
P[I/R] = P[I] * P[R/I]/(P[I] * P[R/I] + P[not I] * P[R/not I]) = 0.05 * 0.3 / (0.05 * 0.3 + 0.95 * 0.1) = 13.6%.
So worst case scenario I only have 13.6% of a chance to go through difficult conversations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remember the examples: the kid who developed perfectionism to prevent punishment or abandonment in their family home and/or did this to gain more of the loving looks and praise they wished for. They may predict that any time they act in a way that could be construed as imperfect, such as getting a bad grade or doing something embarrassing, they will be abandoned. So they spend their whole lives trying to be perfect. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwbs5ywgddzdp1s3xyt9nkb8">View Highlight</a>)<!-- -->

<li>Note: That’s me unfortunately.</li>

<li>If a partner cheated on you, then, in subsequent relationships, any time you see they’ve made a new friend or don’t text for a day or two, what do you think your brain would predict and simulate then? That it is happening again. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwbsa8jzh5f9j6y1nbnwvrnf">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>The world shapes us, teaching us what to believe, what to fear and what to strive for. We then shape the world in return, interpreting our experiences and the actions of others based on what we have experienced in our past and what we believe and fear to be true.

<li>I’m learning that my emotions link to predictions. My brain is predicting and simulating something that happened in my past. But it’s okay. I’m not in my past. I am here. I’m okay. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwbsnqry37khk9ddb3cgr385">View Highlight</a>)</li>

<ul>
<li>Note: :(</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Right now: set a timer for 1 minute. Close (or lower) your eyes. Focus your attention on your breath. When you notice a thought arise, simply say ‘thinking’, and turn your attention back to the breath. When you notice a physical sensation, simply say ‘feeling’, and turn your attention back to the breath.
Afterwards: did you notice the difference between a thought and a feeling? Did you find labelling the experiences in this way, without judgement, helped them pass?
Noticing without judgment can help us gain distance from our thoughts and feelings. The more practice we have, the more easily we will learn to observe and let go of our internal experiences.
Moving forward: start a regular practice of noticing. Up to 5 minutes per day is sufficient. Scan your body from head to toe – when you find any kind of physical sensation, or something you might call an emotion, ask the following questions (there are no right answers; this is purely to get your curiosity going and to start your journey out of your head and back into your body):
• Where do I feel the sensation in my body?
• How big is the feeling? Are there edges to it (for example, is it in my chest but stops at the shoulders)? Or does it fill my whole body?
• What shape would I say it is?
• How does it change (or not) when I pay attention to it?
• If I inhale and exhale slowly, what happens?
• What happens if I expand my awareness to include the sensation and the feeling of my feet on the floor?
• What would I call this feeling? It can have any name under the sun. You could also just label the part of your body where you feel it – you could choose a type of weather it reminds you of, or an emotion label.
If the emotion you find feels too much, identify somewhere that feels relaxed (or less intense) in your body and pay attention to that area until you feel grounded, then slowly turn your attention to a part of the feeling. Then go back to the safe-place on your body, slowly building up the time you can attend to the harder moments.

<li>Emotions arise outside of our conscious control. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwc9gmwfjhxvcz66dkvtk2cz">View Highlight</a>)<!-- -->

<li>Note: A system 1 reaction basically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We may be primed to look for threat. Being on high alert for threat may have helped our ancestors survive better than being on high alert for joyful and pleasant experiences. This may mean that we predict threat and focus on it more than we do on joy – hence why we often can’t shake off the feeling we did something ‘wrong’, or the criticism we were given, while compliments and positive interactions can slip through our fingers like water. To manage this negative skew, write down three good things that happen to you each day (they can be very small moments, such as someone smiled at me in the street today), along with any compliments you receive. This will slowly train your brain to focus on the rewarding moments. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwc9m31b5p6fpvtkka2cxpq4">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>Mild stress (the experience that arises when we feel under pressure in some way) and anxiety is uncomfortable but also incredibly useful. The mobilising energy it brings can make us perform better, faster and quicker. There is an increased sense of ‘I can’ and ‘I must’. There is a magic window where you have just the right amount of concern to snap you into action. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwdgqg1vw0wtbzc6g39rz61r">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>Living with anxiety and panic is a bit like living with a faulty alarm system, one that goes off even when no danger is present. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwdh70ewpkx705vv8qxyqhvs">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>So, if you notice the tension rising, remember this: do something that gets your heart rate going and edges you towards sweating for 5 minutes. I have locked myself in many bathrooms to do star jumps to get my anxiety down. It works. I recommend it. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwdhcdgw3qfmqrzv1qnhneav">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>Common thinking styles that make us miserable
Black and white thinking: we think of everything in absolutes – <em>If everything isn’t perfect, then everything is terrible</em> – when the reality is, most things are grey (somewhere in between).
Filtering: we ignore all of the positive aspects of situations and focus solely on the negative.
Jumping to conclusions: we take a small amount of information and assume we know what’s going to happen – <em>It’s going to go badly</em> – even though the world is unpredictable.
Mind-reading: we assume we know what someone else is thinking – <em>They looked at me funny, they hate me</em> – when we can’t know this to be true unless someone tells us. People may look at you funny for many reasons. They may be having a bad day, or might be squinting because they don’t have their glasses on!
Emotional reasoning: we assume because we feel something it must be true: <em>I feel stupid so I must be stupid.</em> Nope!
Overgeneralisation: we take one event and apply it to everything – <em>This always happens to me. No one ever likes me.</em>
Personalisation: when we make everything personal – <em>Everything is my fault</em> – even in situations where events are out of our control. We can do this to other people too – <em>It’s all their fault.</em>
Catastrophisation: we escalate a worry to the worst possible outcome – <em>The world is going to end!</em>
Discounting the positive: when something goes well, we minimise our success – <em>I did well by chance, it was a fluke.</em> (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwdhzseaw7ewvmq0spf503df">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>When your main coping strategy is removed, whatever the strategy, it can feel like there’s no safety net (when someone takes away the water, how do you put out the fire?). (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwe6xnxz0h73tgegfhbmey5q">View Highlight</a>)</li>

<li>Note: Dr.K: burnout is just too much work for too little reward</li>

<li>This is not a contradiction – not at all. Most perfectionists cannot tolerate being bad at something. It feels too threatening. So, when they try something new that doesn’t come naturally to them, the experience can be so uncomfortable (understatement – it can feel extremely threatening) they immediately give up. This can be the same for change. If we can’t be sure that we can navigate the change perfectly, we may avoid it at all costs.

<li>Going forward: mindfulness (Chapter 13) and self-compassion (Chapter 15) will be your friend, as will regularly picking something each day to do imperfectly. In fact, speaking of friends, top tip: surround yourself with people who are not afraid to be flawed, who are open and willing to admit, ‘I am imperfectly human, and I think it’s great.’ (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwe9cwzq2yg5x0z27aaz3rtn">View Highlight</a>)</li>

That’s an average of 23 times per day. Even when we grow up in a warm and loving environment, that negative skew and immediate ‘No’, ‘Don’t’, ‘Can’t’ may be there to stop us, even as adults.

It feels automatically more empowering. Rather than ‘I should go to the gym’, ‘I could go to the gym’ gives you more choice over your actions and ensures you do the things you wish to do rather than what you feel others think you should do.

<li>I have also dated people’s <em>potential</em>. I have tried to mould them into the person and relationship I saw in our future – a terrible move. Miserable for me and really unfair on them.

<li>When you start dating, you may believe you want a partner but find that things keep getting in the way of you having a relationship that works out.

<li>Even though only a small proportion of people fall into the avoidant attachment style, they make up the largest section of the dating pool. This is because they often cycle in and out of relationships, meaning they arrive back on the dating scene regularly. So, if you are not avoidant, and you feel someone engaging in the push-pull with you, maybe they are!

<li>New habits are most likely to be made when:
• You feel energised. Try to be well-slept and well-nourished. Try to start new habits when you don’t have too many tasks competing for your attention and energy at the same time.
• You are held accountable. Find others who can start your new habits with you, hold each other accountable and support each other through the low-energy days.
• You are prepared for barriers. Look at what’s in your diary that may disrupt your new daily practice. For example, if you want to start practising mindfulness every day but have family coming to stay – and know you won’t have a moment to yourself – plan ahead, decide how you’ll manage this.
• You note down every small success. Your brain may not focus on small successes by itself (as it is so often predicting and remembering the negative). Each time something goes well (e.g. you did your breathing practice, or had a cold shower, and it slowed your panic response) spend 10 seconds focusing on it, really thinking about the success and the feeling.
• You reward yourself. When a new activity isn’t fun or rewarding in itself we don’t look forward to it, and it’s easy to let our practice slide. Choose something you can do immediately after each mindfulness, breathing or other practice that feels good. The rewards don’t have to be big. Mine are usually calling a friend, dancing around my room to loud music and going to the dog park to look at all the furry friends. I will never be the woman who does 50 crunches after breakfast but, with the right incentive (money, bribes, puppies), I just might. Your rewards have to work for you, and not everyone has to agree on whether they are ‘good’ or not. For example, you may worry that your rewards are counterproductive, such as having a whipped-cream latte or fries and a burger after going for a run. However, if you are running because you value moving your body and committing to a hobby, then having a whipped-cream latte that makes you feel happy and rewarded is a brilliant choice. The most important thing is that the reward occurs immediately after the new behaviour, so your brain learns to associate the two things. In the future the reward will hopefully motivate you to practice.
• You start with a very small step and then build from there. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwzvkvv4wnmx1jps7gdzdvet">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>When you are flooded with emotion, your brain is solely focused on surviving the threat it thinks you’re in. By turning your attention to items in your environment that are safe, you start sending signals to the brain that you too are safe. But more than that, you use every sense to do this and to come back into the present moment, out of your emotional response and into the world again.

It emphasizes the importance of recognizing and expressing emotions, seeking connection with others, and developing resilience through shared experiences. Additionally, it touches on the impact of therapy in gaining insight and navigating patterns of behavior for personal growth.\n\n## Highlights\n- For example, do you want to understand how your childhood affects who you are today? How it affects your relationship with yourself and others? Do you wonder why there are experiences from that time that you feel you should be over but don’t quite seem to be able to let go of? If so, you’ll find the explanation here. Do you wonder how social media, marketing and the advertorial content you consume each day affects your emotional wellbeing? Do you want to know what your emotions actually are, where they come from and how to manage them when they threaten to overwhelm you? I will give you useful advice for how to have a healthier relationship with these facets of life. Do you want to believe in yourself and your ability to be content with who you are? If the answer is yes, then it’s all in here.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw8aev0navtyg31r0qq1w4g4))\n    - Note: Children learn different feelings from caregivers. They feel safer and more assured alongside the way. It is absolutely fine to have those feelings but we (the child and the caregivers together) will sort it out.\n- Whatever the reasons, some of us learned early on that adults couldn’t be there for us consistently, that they weren’t always reliable. More than that, we may have learned that connection with others can feel dangerous and that the world is emotionally fraught because of this. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw8bs558b5n77760aqtg1dzk))\n- You may notice that you sometimes feel a little superior to others, seeing another’s ‘neediness’ and emotionality as something unnecessary and something you are relieved you don’t have. This isn’t because you’re arrogant or overly confident. Quite the opposite. This is your mind’s attempt at keeping you safe and your self-esteem up. It protects you from your (maybe unconscious) fear that you may not be someone another person is able to, or would want to, be there for. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw91mge8y6q9v4y3gpqhc5rd))\n- Children who are not listened to, or who have found that neither people-pleasing or perfection helps in any way, may learn that the only way they get the attention they need is by getting angry and/or shouting louder, escalating their behaviours until they have broken enough rules that someone comes to stop them. This is something caregivers rarely understand.

Most would think his dick is too small/he can't last long enough, or her tits are not big enough.\n- If we feel we are doing better than others (this is called downward comparison), we will feel a boost and our self-esteem will go up. If we feel we aren’t doing as well (upward comparison), but feel that with a little practice or effort we could achieve that level, we may feel inspired.\n  If we see a large discrepancy, we may feel inadequate, defeated and lose motivation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw9k81e6kp7d5hcceqvxfy87))\n- Use social comparison to your advantage. If you need motivation, look to people who are doing slightly better than you, who you feel you could aspire to. If you need a boost, look at the people you feel are equal to you and are impressed by (it’s always easier to be proud of someone else’s success than our own), people who are behind you on your journey – perhaps a rung lower on your career ladder – so you can be reminded of how far you’ve come. Or maybe compare yourself to yesterday’s self. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw9m4xa4s8sdjgmrjzwe7bc7))\n- Our brain uses short cuts to make sense of the world. One of these is social proof, the idea that if other people like something it must be good, and if lots of people follow someone they must be right. These short cuts can have us idolising people with huge followings, taking their words and ideas as gospel, wanting to buy anything they are selling, whether what they are selling works for us or not. They can stop us questioning what is right and true.

There are so few options for them to see themselves thriving as someone who struggles or feels. This, coupled with the way we socialise men and boys to be strong and not cry, means men learn that they must not feel or ask for help.\n  Training men not to feel is killing them. In the UK, men are three times more likely to die by suicide than women; in Northern Ireland the number rises to four times more likely, and this is the same in the USA. To the men reading this: *you are allowed to feel, cry AND ask for help*.\n  \u003e Crying releases stress hormones and increases endorphins. Crying is an act of self-care.

Most of the time you lose, but, on occasion, just as you’re about to give up, you win?

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwbjwamz96eegh9jddw7p7hp))\n- To stay safe, our ancestors didn’t wait until a tiger was at their door, the food was gone or they found themselves out in the cold before they reacted to the threats. That could be a lethal mistake. Instead, their brains developed to predict what would happen next, anticipating threats and rewards before they could occur, mounting a physical response that would ensure their survival. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwbk34wkbkeqvq1w34qa3p12))\n- Anyone who has experienced this last one knows how powerful the prediction of danger linked to no phone can be, and how the prediction is almost always wrong.

It's all in my head!\n- The point is:\n  • We do not experience the world exactly as it is.\n  • We experience it based on the predictions we make.\n  • Our predictions are based on our personal history.\n  • The predictions we make cause simulations, which cause physical responses, and we call these emotions.\n  • Our predictions are not always accurate and are sometimes exaggerated.\n  • Our brain will update the information it uses to make predictions when we gain new information ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwbmg2bxekztmakf1cans4jv))\n- Shame is accompanied by the thought ‘I am bad’, while guilt says, ‘I did something bad’.\n  I believe shame is far less useful than guilt. Shame makes us see the world the way as young children, who cannot hold good and bad in their mind at the same time. It makes us believe that one single moment in our life defines us, which is not the case. It can totally paralyse us.

They rejected my request but in the end it's really not that big of a deal.\n- When a worrying thought or anger arises, do as author Brené Brown does: ask yourself, ‘What is the story I’m telling myself right now?’ For example, ‘The story I’m telling myself right now is that this “We need to speak” email is the end of my career, this text the end of my relationship’, or ‘The wild night out and my bad behaviour is the end of my social life’. Remind yourself that this is a prediction. Then check for the evidence. What is the evidence for this fear? What is the evidence against it? If the worst outcome did happen, what is the evidence you would survive it? You can even check out your ‘stories’ with your friends. What evidence do they see that confirms your fears or goes against them? When we are stressed or worried it colours everything we see. It shapes our predictions. Friends who do not feel stressed may be able to offer different evidence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwbn0dxwbs5fgcpqzba904tn))\n    - Note: Bayes theorem.\n      Using Robin as an example. He’s a religious white man, with reasonable income and on his own. From a tenant perspective I’d give him a solid 7/10 (above average).\n      Let’s assume in Toronto landlords have a 5% chance to run into issues when trying to sell. I’d like to evaluate P[Issue | Robin]. For the sake of example I’m exaggerating P[Robin | Issue] as 0.3 (30% of these troublesome tenants fit that description), and P[Robin | no Issue] as 0.1 (10% of the renters are just like Robin).\n      P[I/R] = P[I] * P[R/I]/(P[I] * P[R/I] + P[not I] * P[R/not I]) = 0.05 * 0.3 / (0.05 * 0.3 + 0.95 * 0.1) = 13.6%.\n      So worst case scenario I only have 13.6% of a chance to go through difficult conversations.\n- Remember the examples: the kid who developed perfectionism to prevent punishment or abandonment in their family home and/or did this to gain more of the loving looks and praise they wished for. They may predict that any time they act in a way that could be construed as imperfect, such as getting a bad grade or doing something embarrassing, they will be abandoned. So they spend their whole lives trying to be perfect.

That it is happening again. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwbsa8jzh5f9j6y1nbnwvrnf))\n- The world shapes us, teaching us what to believe, what to fear and what to strive for.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwc98e0q2fhzted3nz0957rk))\n    - Note: :(\n- Right now: set a timer for 1 minute. Close (or lower) your eyes. Focus your attention on your breath. When you notice a thought arise, simply say ‘thinking’, and turn your attention back to the breath. When you notice a physical sensation, simply say ‘feeling’, and turn your attention back to the breath.\n  Afterwards: did you notice the difference between a thought and a feeling? Did you find labelling the experiences in this way, without judgement, helped them pass?\n  Noticing without judgment can help us gain distance from our thoughts and feelings. The more practice we have, the more easily we will learn to observe and let go of our internal experiences.\n  Moving forward: start a regular practice of noticing. Up to 5 minutes per day is sufficient. Scan your body from head to toe – when you find any kind of physical sensation, or something you might call an emotion, ask the following questions (there are no right answers; this is purely to get your curiosity going and to start your journey out of your head and back into your body):\n  • Where do I feel the sensation in my body?\n  • How big is the feeling? Are there edges to it (for example, is it in my chest but stops at the shoulders)? Or does it fill my whole body?\n  • What shape would I say it is?\n  • How does it change (or not) when I pay attention to it?\n  • If I inhale and exhale slowly, what happens?\n  • What happens if I expand my awareness to include the sensation and the feeling of my feet on the floor?\n  • What would I call this feeling? It can have any name under the sun. You could also just label the part of your body where you feel it – you could choose a type of weather it reminds you of, or an emotion label.\n  If the emotion you find feels too much, identify somewhere that feels relaxed (or less intense) in your body and pay attention to that area until you feel grounded, then slowly turn your attention to a part of the feeling. Then go back to the safe-place on your body, slowly building up the time you can attend to the harder moments.

Being on high alert for threat may have helped our ancestors survive better than being on high alert for joyful and pleasant experiences. This may mean that we predict threat and focus on it more than we do on joy – hence why we often can’t shake off the feeling we did something ‘wrong’, or the criticism we were given, while compliments and positive interactions can slip through our fingers like water. To manage this negative skew, write down three good things that happen to you each day (they can be very small moments, such as someone smiled at me in the street today), along with any compliments you receive. This will slowly train your brain to focus on the rewarding moments.

The mobilising energy it brings can make us perform better, faster and quicker. There is an increased sense of ‘I can’ and ‘I must’. There is a magic window where you have just the right amount of concern to snap you into action.

People may look at you funny for many reasons. They may be having a bad day, or might be squinting because they don’t have their glasses on!\n  Emotional reasoning: we assume because we feel something it must be true: *I feel stupid so I must be stupid.* Nope!\n  Overgeneralisation: we take one event and apply it to everything – *This always happens to me. No one ever likes me.*\n  Personalisation: when we make everything personal – *Everything is my fault* – even in situations where events are out of our control. We can do this to other people too – *It’s all their fault.*\n  Catastrophisation: we escalate a worry to the worst possible outcome – *The world is going to end!*\n  Discounting the positive: when something goes well, we minimise our success – *I did well by chance, it was a fluke.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwdhzseaw7ewvmq0spf503df))\n- When your main coping strategy is removed, whatever the strategy, it can feel like there’s no safety net (when someone takes away the water, how do you put out the fire?).

Most perfectionists cannot tolerate being bad at something. It feels too threatening. So, when they try something new that doesn’t come naturally to them, the experience can be so uncomfortable (understatement – it can feel extremely threatening) they immediately give up. This can be the same for change. If we can’t be sure that we can navigate the change perfectly, we may avoid it at all costs.

When we use the word ‘could’, we switch to a position of choice. It feels automatically more empowering. Rather than ‘I should go to the gym’, ‘I could go to the gym’ gives you more choice over your actions and ensures you do the things you wish to do rather than what you feel others think you should do.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwzh6tb87n3yk7yzf46790bs))\n- Even though only a small proportion of people fall into the avoidant attachment style, they make up the largest section of the dating pool. This is because they often cycle in and out of relationships, meaning they arrive back on the dating scene regularly. So, if you are not avoidant, and you feel someone engaging in the push-pull with you, maybe they are! It doesn’t mean you need to ditch them; it means you need to get good at communicating what you need from your date. If they can meet your needs, great. If not, ditch them.

Try to be well-slept and well-nourished. Try to start new habits when you don’t have too many tasks competing for your attention and energy at the same time.\n  • You are held accountable. Find others who can start your new habits with you, hold each other accountable and support each other through the low-energy days.\n  • You are prepared for barriers. Look at what’s in your diary that may disrupt your new daily practice. For example, if you want to start practising mindfulness every day but have family coming to stay – and know you won’t have a moment to yourself – plan ahead, decide how you’ll manage this.\n  • You note down every small success. Your brain may not focus on small successes by itself (as it is so often predicting and remembering the negative). Each time something goes well (e.g. you did your breathing practice, or had a cold shower, and it slowed your panic response) spend 10 seconds focusing on it, really thinking about the success and the feeling.\n  • You reward yourself. When a new activity isn’t fun or rewarding in itself we don’t look forward to it, and it’s easy to let our practice slide. Choose something you can do immediately after each mindfulness, breathing or other practice that feels good. The rewards don’t have to be big. Mine are usually calling a friend, dancing around my room to loud music and going to the dog park to look at all the furry friends. I will never be the woman who does 50 crunches after breakfast but, with the right incentive (money, bribes, puppies), I just might. Your rewards have to work for you, and not everyone has to agree on whether they are ‘good’ or not. For example, you may worry that your rewards are counterproductive, such as having a whipped-cream latte or fries and a burger after going for a run. However, if you are running because you value moving your body and committing to a hobby, then having a whipped-cream latte that makes you feel happy and rewarded is a brilliant choice. The most important thing is that the reward occurs immediately after the new behaviour, so your brain learns to associate the two things. In the future the reward will hopefully motivate you to practice.\n  • You start with a very small step and then build from there.

By turning your attention to items in your environment that are safe, you start sending signals to the brain that you too are safe. But more than that, you use every sense to do this and to come back into the present moment, out of your emotional response and into the world again.
