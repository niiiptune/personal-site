<li>Full Title: The Parasitic Mind</li>
<li>Category: #books</li>
<li>Summary: &quot;The Parasitic Mind&quot; by Gad Saad explores how victim politics and cancel culture are impacting reason and truth in universities, particularly through the lens of social justice warriors. Saad criticizes academia for prioritizing ideology over scientific facts and calls for a renewal of commitment to freedom of speech to combat idea pathogens. The book delves into the dangerous consequences of forbidden knowledge and the prevalence of faux-outrage in modern society.</li>

<li>Has your common sense been thoroughly assaulted? Read this book, strengthen your resolve, and help us all return to reason.”

<li>I am periodically challenged in my dogged efforts to combat the idea pathogens spread by social justice warriors. The criticisms usually take one of two related forms: 1) “Professor Saad, are you not exaggerating the problem? After all, social justice warriors constitute a minority on most campuses.” 2) “Dr. Saad, why don’t you tackle more important problems? Stop obsessing about some quack outliers. Your time would be better spent elsewhere. Discuss science. Teach us about your areas of scientific expertise.” Let me tackle each position in turn with the hope that my responses might compel some people who are quietly watching from the sidelines to join the battle of ideas. On September 11, 2001, nineteen men armed with nothing more than religious fervor and ideological zealotry, killed nearly 3,000 people and permanently altered the New York skyscape if not our collective sense of security. The devastation inflicted by motivated terrorists can greatly exceed their number. Similarly, social justice warriors and their ilk are intellectual terrorists, and they can wreak havoc on reason and our public life, limiting people’s willingness to speak and think freely, without ever constituting a majority.

<li>Some people are truly irredeemably clueless. They post comments attacking me for criticizing the SJW [social justice warrior] mindset instead of supposedly tackling “important” matters. Yes, because having a set of idea pathogens take complete control over the minds and souls of millions of people in academia, government, companies, the media, and the general society in a manner that is akin to religious superstitious dogma is “unimportant.” Having anti-science, anti-reason nonsense taught to children in elementary schools is “unimportant.” Having governments and universities push policies that are antithetical to individual dignity &amp; a meritocratic ethos is “unimportant.” There is NOTHING more important than fighting for freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, and a commitment toward science, reason, &amp; logic over quasi-religious dogma. Those who are incapable of seeing the larger picture are complicit in perpetuating the current zeitgeist of lunacy. That at times I use satire, sarcasm, and humour to battle against the enemies of reason should not detract you from understanding how serious this battle is.<a href="javascript:void(0)">1</a> (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzzqeqt4agfcz8hqte5kkekt">View Highlight</a>)</li>

<li>Many thanks for your email. I am sorry that you won’t be able to make it.
As to your point, I do not subscribe to identity politics and certainly not in science. If the symposium at hand necessitated that most speakers be women, so be it. If in this case, the number of male to female speakers is not “balanced” so be it. I did invite another female speaker but she was unavailable. I did not choose my speakers as a function of whether they ovulate or not. I chose them based on their fit with the topic at hand, their availability, etc.
The US government released data across five races and four educational attainment levels (Associate’s degree, Bachelor’s, Master’s, and doctorate). As such, there were 20 cells to analyze. In EVERY single cell, women outnumbered men. Are you going to push for greater gender parity across the cells because it is difficult to imagine a more “biased” reality?
I should add that we do not know whether any of the male speakers self-identify as women so perhaps the gender parity is more balanced than might first appear.
In any case, thank you for writing in. I hope that we’ll have a chance to interact again. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01j36j4h3ka50ydzvt2jxyxa87">View Highlight</a>)<!-- -->

<li>Note: Polylogism: A philosophical concept that asserts the existence of multiple, equally valid forms of logic or reasoning corresponding to different social, cultural, or historical contexts. It often implies that different groups, such as races or classes, possess distinct modes of thought that are not universally applicable. Polylogism has been criticized as an anti-scientific notion, as it undermines the idea of objective reasoning and the universality of logical principles, suggesting that rationality varies among different groups. Prominent economists and philosophers, including Ludwig von Mises, argued against polylogism, advocating for a singular, objective logic applicable to all human beings.</li>

They cannot be protected in a sanitized bubble expecting that all interactions will be polite, uplifting, and enriching. Just as immunotherapy against food allergies exposes young children to minute traces of the allergens so that, with an incremental increase in the exposure dosage, the body will build immunity against that particular allergen, so too do people need to be exposed to the full repertoire of human interactions so that they can develop as intellectually and emotionally healthy individuals.

1(主要) 目標。
Saving energy is the new management mantra. 節省能源是新的管理目標。The Yankees’ mantra for weeks has been that they’re still chasing a division title not a wild-card berth. 幾星期來洋基的主要目標仍然是爭取分區冠軍而非外卡資格。
2競選口號。
To his mantra “you have the power”, he added “I need your help”. 他在自己的競選口號「你有力量」上加上一句「我需要你的幫忙」。
3宣傳口號。
What the tobacco companies find particularly frustrating is the Florida jury’s deafness to their ‘90s mantra － we’re changed. 煙草公司感到特別洩氣的是佛州陪審團對他們在九零年代推出的宣傳口號－我們不同了－置若罔聞。
4訴求。
In rich countries, the familiar mantra of a low-fat diet and exercise is routinely ignored. 在富裕的國家，大家經常聽到的低脂飲食和多運動的訴求經常被忽視。Its mantra, though, is not democracy but the promotion of Chinese nationalism. 不過，它的訴求不是民主而是提倡中國的民族主義。
5使命。
He made the pursuit of a harmonious society his personal mantra. 他把追求和諧的社會奉為個人的使命。
6口號。
His new mantra is “big market, small government”. 他的新口號是「大市場，小政府」。The public bought his mantra of “no economic growth without structural reform”. 民眾接受他喊出「沒有結構性改革就沒有經濟成長」的口號。
7主張。
He is sticking to his mantra that the world can be divided into black and white, with no shades of gray in between. 他堅信世界可分為黑白，中間沒有灰色地帶的主張。India’s new prime minister is also repeating the mantra of modesty. 印度新任總理也重申儉樸的主張。
8訴求重點。
Kerry’s mantra: Bush has no grasp of reality beyond that enjoyed by his rich corporate friends. 凱瑞的訴求重點：布希除了他富有的企業友人所享有的一切之外並不瞭解現實狀況。
9論點。
While they listened intently to his every word, they weren’t convinced by his mantra. 他們雖然聚精會神地聆聽他所說的每一句話，卻不相信他的論點。</li>

<li>Merchants of faux-outrage can not only ascribe victimhood status to Palestinian women for <em>not</em> being raped, but they can also construe kindness as a form of Islamophobia. Anisa Rawhani conducted an experiment at Queen’s University: she wore a hijab for eighteen days to examine people’s reactions to her.<a href="#ch05note60">60</a> Undoubtedly, the working hypothesis was that bigotry and prejudice would be ubiquitous. She was taken aback by the fact that people were very kind and polite to her. In an extraordinary attempt to salvage the victimology narrative, she concluded that this manifest tolerance and kindness was a means by which people overcompensated for their concealed bigotry. If you are unkind to a Muslim woman, you are an Islamophobe. If you are kind to a Muslim woman, you are an Islamophobe. All roads lead to Islamophobia. Being kind and tolerant is a form of racism in the ecosystem of the university campus. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3bhsb4sb7w3zad91487ypvh">View Highlight</a>)</li>

Lysenko&#x27;s ideas aligned with Marxist ideology, emphasizing the potential for transformation and improvement of crops through collective agricultural practices. His influence on Soviet agricultural policy led to widespread adoption of unscientific methods, resulting in agricultural failures and significant negative impacts on food production. Lysenko&#x27;s political connections allowed him to suppress dissenting scientific views, leading to the persecution of geneticists who opposed his theories and causing a long-lasting impact on Soviet biology and agriculture.</li>

<li>Why do individuals succumb to such shoddy thinking? In his book <em>The Conduct of Inquiry</em>, the philosopher Abraham Kaplan wrote: “In addition to the social pressures from the scientific community, there is also at work a very human trait of individual scientists. I call it the <em>law of instrument</em>, and it may be formulated as follows: Give a small boy a hammer, and he will find that everything he encounters needs pounding. It comes as no particular surprise to discover that a scientist formulates problems in a way which requires for their solution just those techniques in which he himself is especially skilled.”<a href="#ch06note20">20</a> [Italics in original.] The humanist psychologist Abraham Maslow in <em>The Psychology of Science</em> added: “I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.”<a href="#ch06note21">21</a> This is very much related to the notion of methodological fixation, which occurs when researchers become single-minded about the use of specific data collection or data analytic procedures irrespective of their suitability for a given research problem.<a href="#ch06note22">22</a> If you are a climate activist, all calamities are due to man-made climate change.

<li>In the philosophy of science, the principle of “Ockham’s razor” means that all things being equal, simple explanations should be preferred to convoluted ones (a useful guard against the faulty epistemology of faux-causality). In his <em>Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica</em>, Sir Isaac Newton proclaimed: “We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances. To this purpose the philosophers say that Nature does nothing in vain, and more is in vain when less will serve; for Nature is pleased with simplicity and affects not the pomp of superfluous causes.” The problem with those who succumb to the Six Degrees of Faux-Causality trap is that they generate long sequences of illusory causal pathways.

But we know through our studies and observation that the illiberal mix of cultures poses one of the greatest dilemmas and an unprecedented challenge to liberal societies such as ours, when there is no demand placed on immigrants any longer to assimilate into the founding liberal values of the country to which they have immigrated. Instead, a misguided and thoroughly wrong-headed policy of multiculturalism encourages the opposite.…</p>
<p>We may want to continue with a level of immigration into Canada annually that is about the same as it is at present. We cannot, however, continue with such an inflow of immigrants under the present arrangement of the official policy of multiculturalism based on the premise that all cultures are equal when this is untrue. This policy is a severe, perhaps even a lethal, test for a liberal democracy such as ours.…</p>
<p>We should not allow bureaucratic inertia to determine not only the policy but the existing level of immigrant numbers and source origin that Canada brings in annually. We have the precedent of how we selectively closed immigration from the Soviet bloc countries during the Cold War years, and we need to consider doing the same in terms of immigration from Muslim countries for a period of time given how disruptive is the cultural baggage of illiberal values that is brought in as a result.</p>
<p>We are, in other words, stoking the fuel of much unrest in our country, as we have witnessed of late in Europe.</p>
<p>Lest any member wants to instruct me that my views are in any way politically incorrect, or worse, I would like members to note that I come before you as a practising Muslim who knows out of experience, from the inside, how volatile, how disruptive, how violent, how misogynistic is the culture of Islam today and has been during my lifetime, and how it greatly threatens our liberal democracy that I cherish, since I know what is its opposite.

<ul>
<li>Note: Ostrich Parasitic Syndrome: A metaphorical term that describes a phenomenon wherein individuals or groups deliberately ignore harmful realities or challenges in favor of a false sense of security or optimism. This syndrome is often invoked in discussions about social or political issues, suggesting that like ostriches, which are said to bury their heads in the sand when threatened, some people may choose to overlook pressing problems rather than confront them. The term is used in various contexts, including discussions of religious, cultural, and societal dynamics, as a critique of avoidance behavior in the face of adversity.</li>

<li>Note: Sharia law: A legal system rooted in Islamic principles derived from the Quran, Hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad), and other Islamic texts. It encompasses a wide range of moral, ethical, and legal guidelines governing the lives of Muslims, influencing aspects such as personal conduct, family relations, and social justice. Sharia law varies in interpretation and implementation across different cultures and communities, leading to diverse practices. While some view it as a comprehensive legal framework, others criticize it for its perceived incompatibility with secular legal systems, particularly in Western contexts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharia law specifically states that no retaliation can take place when a Muslim kills a non-Muslim and that indemnities depend on the identities of the parties in question.<!-- -->
<blockquote>
<p>04.9 (A: For the rulings below, one multiplies the fraction named by the indemnity appropriate to the death or injury’s type of intentionality and other relevant circumstances that determine the amount of a male Muslim’s indemnity (def: 04.2-6 and 04.13).)</p>
<p>The indemnity for the death or injury of a woman is one-half the indemnity paid for a man.</p>
<p>The indemnity paid for a Jew or Christian is one-third of the indemnity paid for a Muslim.</p>

<li>This is what identity politics does to a legal system—and this is precisely the standard adhered to by progressives. Men can be sexist, but women can’t be. Whites can be racist, but blacks can’t be. Permissible speech is governed by identity and political allegiance. A straight white Christian conservative man should shut his mouth and cede the floor to the progressive Muslim indigenous trans woman of color. Know your place, white guy. Don’t speak out of turn. Hence, it is true that both sharia law and progressive identity politics adhere to the exact same principle. The repercussions of this fundamental attack on individual rights manifest themselves differently across the two ecosystems, but the mindset is nearly identical. The only difference is that progressives uphold the idea of equality, which sharia law does not. Still, progressive equality is a very special kind of equality. It was best captured in the immortal words of George Orwell in his novel <em>Animal Farm</em>: “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3ebs0xktmwt26zdpxrdvsbp">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>An extraordinarily chilling and instructive example of this dreadful trend occurred in the Netherlands in 2010. Geert Wilders, a Dutch parliamentarian, was charged with a slew of crimes for having the temerity to criticize Islam and its growing influence in his country. Any freedom-loving reader should be appalled that criticism of a religion is now considered hate speech in many Western countries. As part of his defense strategy, Mr. Wilders sought to call on expert witnesses to validate the veracity of his stated public positions. The response from the prosecutor’s office (<em>Openbaar ministerie</em>) was truly breathtaking: “It is irrelevant whether Wilders’s witnesses might prove Wilders’s observations to be correct. What’s relevant is that his observations are illegal.”<a href="javascript:void(0)">12</a> In a free society, people should have the right to criticize a religion; they should have the right to do so, and of course their criticisms are themselves open to criticism; that is the essence of freedom of speech and thought. In this case, the prosecution was beyond Orwellian, stating flatly that <em>telling the truth could be illegal</em>. This mindset is increasingly prevalent in academia, and it falls under the rubric of forbidden knowledge (see the recent case of Noah Carl who dared to support researchers’ right to study the relationship between race and intelligence).<a href="javascript:void(0)">13</a> (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01j34b0pje68evn89bs41485fh">View Highlight</a>)</li>

Ultimately, the process of accumulating evidence helps establish consensus within the scientific community, guiding future research and shaping the direction of scientific inquiry.

As such, female gametes are precious and rare while those of men are abundant and cheap. Add the physiological costs of gestation and breastfeeding, the risk of childbirth mortality, and other sex-specific costs (women are at increased risk of predation when they are pregnant), and the parental investment scale tilts overwhelmingly toward women. Parental investment theory would predict that women would be much less interested in unrestricted sexuality than men—and this is universally true.

<li>Another reason people are reluctant to join the battle of ideas is what we call “diffusion of responsibility” or “the bystander effect.” In the late 1960s, psychologists John Darley and Bibb Latané documented what at first glance seems counterintuitive. The greater the number of people present, the less likely an individual is to help someone in need because it is easier to rationalize that someone else will do it. It is easy to diffuse responsibility to others who are willing to stick their necks out: “Thank you, Dr. Saad, for standing up on our behalf. I really support your efforts. You got this.” No, I don’t. Everybody has a voice. Activate your sense of personal responsibility. You have agency. Participate. Do not be a bystander as truth, reason, and logic call out for your help. Do not subcontract your voice to others. Do not self-censor. You and your children have a stake in the outcome of this battle, so don’t be afraid to speak up. Do not succumb to the Tragedy of the Commons (as popularized by the ecologist Garrett Hardin in 1968), in this case a tragedy of collective inaction.

<li>Each time that a terrorist attack takes place in some Western city, nauseating hordes of cowards do one of two things: 1) Change their social media handles to the flag of the country that was attacked; 2) Share a hashtag on Twitter to signal their solidarity with a given cause (#JeSuisCharlie following the terror killings at the <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> offices in Paris; #BringBackOurGirls, made famous by Michelle Obama, in support of the Nigerian girls kidnapped by Boko Haram). Politicians seek to outdo one another in offering vacuous “heartfelt” condolences while in many cases continuing to enact policies that are directly responsible for the terror attacks in question. In the great majority of instances, these are utterly useless endeavors meant to do nothing but advertise one’s supposed virtue to the world (hence the term virtue-signaling). It is a form of cheap and costless self-aggrandizing that feeds one’s ego. I must be a good person who truly cares, as evidenced by my progressive hashtag. Nothing could be further from the truth. Those who engage in such platitudinous signaling are cowardly and meek. I’ll use some fundamental principles from evolutionary biology to explain why this is so.

<li>To criticize Islam does not make you an Islamophobe (a nonsensical term) nor a hater of individual Muslims. To scrutinize radical feminism does not make you a misogynist. To question open borders does not make you a racist. You can have an open heart filled with empathy and compassion and yet reject open borders. To assert that trans women (biological males) should not be competing in athletic competitions with biological females does not make you a transphobe. Many situations in life involve a calculus of competing rights. With that in mind, the right of your eight-year-old daughter to feel comfortable and safe in a public bathroom supersedes that of a 230-pound, six foot two trans woman. To reject the idea that so-called “other forms of knowing” (whether the indigenous way of knowing or postmodernism) are as valid as the scientific method does not make you a close-minded bigot. To reject the hysterical demonization of white men as exemplars of toxic masculinity and white supremacy does not make you Adolf Hitler. The name-calling accusations are locked and loaded threats, ready to be deployed against you should you dare to question the relevant progressive tenets. Most people are too afraid to be accused of being racist or misogynist, and so they cower in silence. Keep your mouth shut and nod in agreement or else prepare to be tarred and feathered. Don’t fall prey to this silencing strategy. Be assured in your principles and stand ready to defend them with the ferocity of a honey badger.

The criticisms usually take one of two related forms: 1) “Professor Saad, are you not exaggerating the problem? After all, social justice warriors constitute a minority on most campuses.” 2) “Dr. Saad, why don’t you tackle more important problems? Stop obsessing about some quack outliers. Your time would be better spent elsewhere. Discuss science. Teach us about your areas of scientific expertise.” Let me tackle each position in turn with the hope that my responses might compel some people who are quietly watching from the sidelines to join the battle of ideas. On September 11, 2001, nineteen men armed with nothing more than religious fervor and ideological zealotry, killed nearly 3,000 people and permanently altered the New York skyscape if not our collective sense of security.

They cannot be protected in a sanitized bubble expecting that all interactions will be polite, uplifting, and enriching.

Lysenko's ideas aligned with Marxist ideology, emphasizing the potential for transformation and improvement of crops through collective agricultural practices. His influence on Soviet agricultural policy led to widespread adoption of unscientific methods, resulting in agricultural failures and significant negative impacts on food production. Lysenko's political connections allowed him to suppress dissenting scientific views, leading to the persecution of geneticists who opposed his theories and causing a long-lasting impact on Soviet biology and agriculture.\n- Why do individuals succumb to such shoddy thinking? In his book *The Conduct of Inquiry*, the philosopher Abraham Kaplan wrote: “In addition to the social pressures from the scientific community, there is also at work a very human trait of individual scientists. I call it the *law of instrument*, and it may be formulated as follows: Give a small boy a hammer, and he will find that everything he encounters needs pounding. It comes as no particular surprise to discover that a scientist formulates problems in a way which requires for their solution just those techniques in which he himself is especially skilled.”[20](#ch06note20) [Italics in original.] The humanist psychologist Abraham Maslow in *The Psychology of Science* added: “I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.”[21](#ch06note21) This is very much related to the notion of methodological fixation, which occurs when researchers become single-minded about the use of specific data collection or data analytic procedures irrespective of their suitability for a given research problem.[22](#ch06note22) If you are a climate activist, all calamities are due to man-made climate change.

In his *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*, Sir Isaac Newton proclaimed: “We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances. To this purpose the philosophers say that Nature does nothing in vain, and more is in vain when less will serve; for Nature is pleased with simplicity and affects not the pomp of superfluous causes.” The problem with those who succumb to the Six Degrees of Faux-Causality trap is that they generate long sequences of illusory causal pathways.

But we know through our studies and observation that the illiberal mix of cultures poses one of the greatest dilemmas and an unprecedented challenge to liberal societies such as ours, when there is no demand placed on immigrants any longer to assimilate into the founding liberal values of the country to which they have immigrated. Instead, a misguided and thoroughly wrong-headed policy of multiculturalism encourages the opposite.…\n  \u003e \n  \u003e We may want to continue with a level of immigration into Canada annually that is about the same as it is at present. We cannot, however, continue with such an inflow of immigrants under the present arrangement of the official policy of multiculturalism based on the premise that all cultures are equal when this is untrue. This policy is a severe, perhaps even a lethal, test for a liberal democracy such as ours.…\n  \u003e \n  \u003e We should not allow bureaucratic inertia to determine not only the policy but the existing level of immigrant numbers and source origin that Canada brings in annually. We have the precedent of how we selectively closed immigration from the Soviet bloc countries during the Cold War years, and we need to consider doing the same in terms of immigration from Muslim countries for a period of time given how disruptive is the cultural baggage of illiberal values that is brought in as a result.\n  \u003e \n  \u003e We are, in other words, stoking the fuel of much unrest in our country, as we have witnessed of late in Europe.\n  \u003e \n  \u003e Lest any member wants to instruct me that my views are in any way politically incorrect, or worse, I would like members to note that I come before you as a practising Muslim who knows out of experience, from the inside, how volatile, how disruptive, how violent, how misogynistic is the culture of Islam today and has been during my lifetime, and how it greatly threatens our liberal democracy that I cherish, since I know what is its opposite.

This syndrome is often invoked in discussions about social or political issues, suggesting that like ostriches, which are said to bury their heads in the sand when threatened, some people may choose to overlook pressing problems rather than confront them.

It encompasses a wide range of moral, ethical, and legal guidelines governing the lives of Muslims, influencing aspects such as personal conduct, family relations, and social justice. Sharia law varies in interpretation and implementation across different cultures and communities, leading to diverse practices. While some view it as a comprehensive legal framework, others criticize it for its perceived incompatibility with secular legal systems, particularly in Western contexts.\n- Sharia law specifically states that no retaliation can take place when a Muslim kills a non-Muslim and that indemnities depend on the identities of the parties in question.\n  \u003e 04.9 (A: For the rulings below, one multiplies the fraction named by the indemnity appropriate to the death or injury’s type of intentionality and other relevant circumstances that determine the amount of a male Muslim’s indemnity (def: 04.2-6 and 04.13).)\n  \u003e \n  \u003e The indemnity for the death or injury of a woman is one-half the indemnity paid for a man.\n  \u003e \n  \u003e The indemnity paid for a Jew or Christian is one-third of the indemnity paid for a Muslim.\n  \u003e \n  \u003e The indemnity paid for a Zoroastrian is one-fifteenth of that of a Muslim.

Men can be sexist, but women can’t be. Whites can be racist, but blacks can’t be. Permissible speech is governed by identity and political allegiance. A straight white Christian conservative man should shut his mouth and cede the floor to the progressive Muslim indigenous trans woman of color. Know your place, white guy. Don’t speak out of turn. Hence, it is true that both sharia law and progressive identity politics adhere to the exact same principle. The repercussions of this fundamental attack on individual rights manifest themselves differently across the two ecosystems, but the mindset is nearly identical. The only difference is that progressives uphold the idea of equality, which sharia law does not. Still, progressive equality is a very special kind of equality. It was best captured in the immortal words of George Orwell in his novel *Animal Farm*: “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3ebs0xktmwt26zdpxrdvsbp))\n- An extraordinarily chilling and instructive example of this dreadful trend occurred in the Netherlands in 2010. Geert Wilders, a Dutch parliamentarian, was charged with a slew of crimes for having the temerity to criticize Islam and its growing influence in his country. Any freedom-loving reader should be appalled that criticism of a religion is now considered hate speech in many Western countries. As part of his defense strategy, Mr. Wilders sought to call on expert witnesses to validate the veracity of his stated public positions. The response from the prosecutor’s office (*Openbaar ministerie*) was truly breathtaking: “It is irrelevant whether Wilders’s witnesses might prove Wilders’s observations to be correct. What’s relevant is that his observations are illegal.”[12](private://read/01hyrtnffdxhq0dtd2fzptfzrd/#ch02note12) In a free society, people should have the right to criticize a religion; they should have the right to do so, and of course their criticisms are themselves open to criticism; that is the essence of freedom of speech and thought. In this case, the prosecution was beyond Orwellian, stating flatly that *telling the truth could be illegal*.

The greater the number of people present, the less likely an individual is to help someone in need because it is easier to rationalize that someone else will do it. It is easy to diffuse responsibility to others who are willing to stick their necks out: “Thank you, Dr. Saad, for standing up on our behalf. I really support your efforts. You got this.” No, I don’t. Everybody has a voice. Activate your sense of personal responsibility. You have agency. Participate. Do not be a bystander as truth, reason, and logic call out for your help. Do not subcontract your voice to others. Do not self-censor.
