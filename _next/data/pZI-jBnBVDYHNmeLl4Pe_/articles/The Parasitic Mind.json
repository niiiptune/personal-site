Saad criticizes academia for prioritizing ideology over scientific facts and calls for a renewal of commitment to freedom of speech to combat idea pathogens. The book delves into the dangerous consequences of forbidden knowledge and the prevalence of faux-outrage in modern society.\n\n## Highlights\n- Has your common sense been thoroughly assaulted? Read this book, strengthen your resolve, and help us all return to reason.”\n  —JORDAN PETERSON ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzzq01nm1nsmz3mwy4q373yw))\n- I am periodically challenged in my dogged efforts to combat the idea pathogens spread by social justice warriors. The criticisms usually take one of two related forms: 1) “Professor Saad, are you not exaggerating the problem? After all, social justice warriors constitute a minority on most campuses.” 2) “Dr. Saad, why don’t you tackle more important problems? Stop obsessing about some quack outliers. Your time would be better spent elsewhere. Discuss science. Teach us about your areas of scientific expertise.” Let me tackle each position in turn with the hope that my responses might compel some people who are quietly watching from the sidelines to join the battle of ideas. On September 11, 2001, nineteen men armed with nothing more than religious fervor and ideological zealotry, killed nearly 3,000 people and permanently altered the New York skyscape if not our collective sense of security. The devastation inflicted by motivated terrorists can greatly exceed their number. Similarly, social justice warriors and their ilk are intellectual terrorists, and they can wreak havoc on reason and our public life, limiting people’s willingness to speak and think freely, without ever constituting a majority.

They post comments attacking me for criticizing the SJW [social justice warrior] mindset instead of supposedly tackling “important” matters. Yes, because having a set of idea pathogens take complete control over the minds and souls of millions of people in academia, government, companies, the media, and the general society in a manner that is akin to religious superstitious dogma is “unimportant.” Having anti-science, anti-reason nonsense taught to children in elementary schools is “unimportant.” Having governments and universities push policies that are antithetical to individual dignity & a meritocratic ethos is “unimportant.” There is NOTHING more important than fighting for freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, and a commitment toward science, reason, & logic over quasi-religious dogma. Those who are incapable of seeing the larger picture are complicit in perpetuating the current zeitgeist of lunacy. That at times I use satire, sarcasm, and humour to battle against the enemies of reason should not detract you from understanding how serious this battle is.[1](private://read/01hyrtnffdxhq0dtd2fzptfzrd/#prefacenote1) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzzqeqt4agfcz8hqte5kkekt))\n- My goal is to defend the truth, and today it is the left’s pathogenic ideas that are leading us to an abyss of infinite, irrational darkness.

It should be capable of withstanding ironic, satirical, and sarcastic attacks. If it is too brittle to do so, it is undoubtedly a falsehood. Satirists have recognized this for millennia, as evidenced by the works of Horace, Aristophanes, Juvenal, Lucian of Samosata, Al-Ma’arri, Voltaire, Fran*ç*ois Rabelais, Jonathan Swift, Oscar Wilde, Mark Twain, Ambrose Bierce, and George Orwell. I would also include comedians like Lenny Bruce and George Carlin, the television show *South Park*, and magazines like *Mad* and *Charlie Hebdo*.

The author likely uses his name to illustrate a broader critique of conservative attitudes in the current cultural landscape.\n- Many thanks for your email. I am sorry that you won’t be able to make it.\n  As to your point, I do not subscribe to identity politics and certainly not in science. If the symposium at hand necessitated that most speakers be women, so be it. If in this case, the number of male to female speakers is not “balanced” so be it. I did invite another female speaker but she was unavailable. I did not choose my speakers as a function of whether they ovulate or not. I chose them based on their fit with the topic at hand, their availability, etc.\n  The US government released data across five races and four educational attainment levels (Associate’s degree, Bachelor’s, Master’s, and doctorate). As such, there were 20 cells to analyze. In EVERY single cell, women outnumbered men. Are you going to push for greater gender parity across the cells because it is difficult to imagine a more “biased” reality?\n  I should add that we do not know whether any of the male speakers self-identify as women so perhaps the gender parity is more balanced than might first appear.\n  In any case, thank you for writing in. I hope that we’ll have a chance to interact again.

This is a defining feature of history. It is an indelible part of *Homo sapiens*. Should we adopt a global standard wherein any and all ceremonies must begin with a forensic historical accounting of all peoples who laid claim to a given land? If so, Jews should insist that all future events that take place in Saudi Arabia start off by recognizing the historical rights of the Banu Nadir, the Banu Qaynuqa, and the Banu Qurayza, Jewish tribes that existed in the region prior to the ascent of Islam.

It often implies that different groups, such as races or classes, possess distinct modes of thought that are not universally applicable. Polylogism has been criticized as an anti-scientific notion, as it undermines the idea of objective reasoning and the universality of logical principles, suggesting that rationality varies among different groups. Prominent economists and philosophers, including Ludwig von Mises, argued against polylogism, advocating for a singular, objective logic applicable to all human beings.\n- If Saudi Arabia’s state religion is Islam, the official quasi-religion of Western universities is Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity (or DIE for short).

Healthy human beings are anti-fragile. In other words, people have to be exposed to the ugliness of social interactions. They cannot be protected in a sanitized bubble expecting that all interactions will be polite, uplifting, and enriching. Just as immunotherapy against food allergies exposes young children to minute traces of the allergens so that, with an incremental increase in the exposure dosage, the body will build immunity against that particular allergen, so too do people need to be exposed to the full repertoire of human interactions so that they can develop as intellectually and emotionally healthy individuals.

Individuals with Munchausen Syndrome often have a deep-seated need for attention and may go to great lengths to maintain their fabricated illnesses, including manipulating medical records and lying about their medical history. Treatment typically involves psychotherapy and addressing underlying psychological issues.\n- First, the activists push a mantra of “healthy at any size” and deny that obesity is linked to a wide variety of serious diseases.

Anisa Rawhani conducted an experiment at Queen’s University: she wore a hijab for eighteen days to examine people’s reactions to her.[60](#ch05note60) Undoubtedly, the working hypothesis was that bigotry and prejudice would be ubiquitous. She was taken aback by the fact that people were very kind and polite to her. In an extraordinary attempt to salvage the victimology narrative, she concluded that this manifest tolerance and kindness was a means by which people overcompensated for their concealed bigotry. If you are unkind to a Muslim woman, you are an Islamophobe. If you are kind to a Muslim woman, you are an Islamophobe. All roads lead to Islamophobia. Being kind and tolerant is a form of racism in the ecosystem of the university campus.

Lysenko's ideas aligned with Marxist ideology, emphasizing the potential for transformation and improvement of crops through collective agricultural practices. His influence on Soviet agricultural policy led to widespread adoption of unscientific methods, resulting in agricultural failures and significant negative impacts on food production. Lysenko's political connections allowed him to suppress dissenting scientific views, leading to the persecution of geneticists who opposed his theories and causing a long-lasting impact on Soviet biology and agriculture.\n- Why do individuals succumb to such shoddy thinking? In his book *The Conduct of Inquiry*, the philosopher Abraham Kaplan wrote: “In addition to the social pressures from the scientific community, there is also at work a very human trait of individual scientists. I call it the *law of instrument*, and it may be formulated as follows: Give a small boy a hammer, and he will find that everything he encounters needs pounding. It comes as no particular surprise to discover that a scientist formulates problems in a way which requires for their solution just those techniques in which he himself is especially skilled.”[20](#ch06note20) [Italics in original.] The humanist psychologist Abraham Maslow in *The Psychology of Science* added: “I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.”[21](#ch06note21) This is very much related to the notion of methodological fixation, which occurs when researchers become single-minded about the use of specific data collection or data analytic procedures irrespective of their suitability for a given research problem.[22](#ch06note22) If you are a climate activist, all calamities are due to man-made climate change. If you are a radical feminist, the patriarchy along with toxic masculinity are to blame. (Perhaps not surprisingly climate change has been blamed on toxic masculinity.[23](#ch06note23)) If you are a member of the Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity cult, then naturally all ills stem from a lack of diversity, inclusion, and equity.

In his *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*, Sir Isaac Newton proclaimed: “We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances. To this purpose the philosophers say that Nature does nothing in vain, and more is in vain when less will serve; for Nature is pleased with simplicity and affects not the pomp of superfluous causes.” The problem with those who succumb to the Six Degrees of Faux-Causality trap is that they generate long sequences of illusory causal pathways.

But we know through our studies and observation that the illiberal mix of cultures poses one of the greatest dilemmas and an unprecedented challenge to liberal societies such as ours, when there is no demand placed on immigrants any longer to assimilate into the founding liberal values of the country to which they have immigrated. Instead, a misguided and thoroughly wrong-headed policy of multiculturalism encourages the opposite.…\n  > \n  > We may want to continue with a level of immigration into Canada annually that is about the same as it is at present. We cannot, however, continue with such an inflow of immigrants under the present arrangement of the official policy of multiculturalism based on the premise that all cultures are equal when this is untrue. This policy is a severe, perhaps even a lethal, test for a liberal democracy such as ours.…\n  > \n  > We should not allow bureaucratic inertia to determine not only the policy but the existing level of immigrant numbers and source origin that Canada brings in annually. We have the precedent of how we selectively closed immigration from the Soviet bloc countries during the Cold War years, and we need to consider doing the same in terms of immigration from Muslim countries for a period of time given how disruptive is the cultural baggage of illiberal values that is brought in as a result.\n  > \n  > We are, in other words, stoking the fuel of much unrest in our country, as we have witnessed of late in Europe.\n  > \n  > Lest any member wants to instruct me that my views are in any way politically incorrect, or worse, I would like members to note that I come before you as a practising Muslim who knows out of experience, from the inside, how volatile, how disruptive, how violent, how misogynistic is the culture of Islam today and has been during my lifetime, and how it greatly threatens our liberal democracy that I cherish, since I know what is its opposite.

This syndrome is often invoked in discussions about social or political issues, suggesting that like ostriches, which are said to bury their heads in the sand when threatened, some people may choose to overlook pressing problems rather than confront them. The term is used in various contexts, including discussions of religious, cultural, and societal dynamics, as a critique of avoidance behavior in the face of adversity.\n- sharia law ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3ebmeqn85q4rarjwpgh8mp5))\n    - Note: Sharia law: A legal system rooted in Islamic principles derived from the Quran, Hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad), and other Islamic texts. It encompasses a wide range of moral, ethical, and legal guidelines governing the lives of Muslims, influencing aspects such as personal conduct, family relations, and social justice. Sharia law varies in interpretation and implementation across different cultures and communities, leading to diverse practices. While some view it as a comprehensive legal framework, others criticize it for its perceived incompatibility with secular legal systems, particularly in Western contexts.\n- Sharia law specifically states that no retaliation can take place when a Muslim kills a non-Muslim and that indemnities depend on the identities of the parties in question.\n  > 04.9 (A: For the rulings below, one multiplies the fraction named by the indemnity appropriate to the death or injury’s type of intentionality and other relevant circumstances that determine the amount of a male Muslim’s indemnity (def: 04.2-6 and 04.13).)\n  > \n  > The indemnity for the death or injury of a woman is one-half the indemnity paid for a man.\n  > \n  > The indemnity paid for a Jew or Christian is one-third of the indemnity paid for a Muslim.\n  > \n  > The indemnity paid for a Zoroastrian is one-fifteenth of that of a Muslim.

Men can be sexist, but women can’t be. Whites can be racist, but blacks can’t be. Permissible speech is governed by identity and political allegiance. A straight white Christian conservative man should shut his mouth and cede the floor to the progressive Muslim indigenous trans woman of color. Know your place, white guy. Don’t speak out of turn. Hence, it is true that both sharia law and progressive identity politics adhere to the exact same principle. The repercussions of this fundamental attack on individual rights manifest themselves differently across the two ecosystems, but the mindset is nearly identical. The only difference is that progressives uphold the idea of equality, which sharia law does not. Still, progressive equality is a very special kind of equality. It was best captured in the immortal words of George Orwell in his novel *Animal Farm*: “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3ebs0xktmwt26zdpxrdvsbp))\n- An extraordinarily chilling and instructive example of this dreadful trend occurred in the Netherlands in 2010. Geert Wilders, a Dutch parliamentarian, was charged with a slew of crimes for having the temerity to criticize Islam and its growing influence in his country. Any freedom-loving reader should be appalled that criticism of a religion is now considered hate speech in many Western countries. As part of his defense strategy, Mr. Wilders sought to call on expert witnesses to validate the veracity of his stated public positions. The response from the prosecutor’s office (*Openbaar ministerie*) was truly breathtaking: “It is irrelevant whether Wilders’s witnesses might prove Wilders’s observations to be correct. What’s relevant is that his observations are illegal.”[12](private://read/01hyrtnffdxhq0dtd2fzptfzrd/#ch02note12) In a free society, people should have the right to criticize a religion; they should have the right to do so, and of course their criticisms are themselves open to criticism; that is the essence of freedom of speech and thought. In this case, the prosecution was beyond Orwellian, stating flatly that *telling the truth could be illegal*. This mindset is increasingly prevalent in academia, and it falls under the rubric of forbidden knowledge (see the recent case of Noah Carl who dared to support researchers’ right to study the relationship between race and intelligence).[13](private://read/01hyrtnffdxhq0dtd2fzptfzrd/#ch02note13) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j34b0pje68evn89bs41485fh))\n- **Rogan:** What if that truth hurts your feelings?\n  **Me:** Fuck your feelings.

Second, the informational landscape is laden with data of varying levels of veracity.

In scientific paradigms, this evidence builds a foundation for understanding and explaining natural phenomena, allowing researchers to refine or change their hypotheses as new information emerges. Ultimately, the process of accumulating evidence helps establish consensus within the scientific community, guiding future research and shaping the direction of scientific inquiry.\n      Nomology指无法用公理证明的科学推断。\n- Men preferred younger mates in all studied cultures (thirty-seven out of thirty-seven) and cared more about physical attraction in thirty-four of the thirty-seven cultures. Women assigned greater importance to a partner’s financial prospect (thirty-six cultures) and ambition/industriousness (twenty-nine cultures). Statistically significant findings that were contrary to evolutionary expectations were exceptionally rare.

Women produce on average 400 fertilizable ova from the onset of their menstrual cycle to menopause while men produce on average 250 million spermatozoa in a single ejaculation. As such, female gametes are precious and rare while those of men are abundant and cheap. Add the physiological costs of gestation and breastfeeding, the risk of childbirth mortality, and other sex-specific costs (women are at increased risk of predation when they are pregnant), and the parental investment scale tilts overwhelmingly toward women. Parental investment theory would predict that women would be much less interested in unrestricted sexuality than men—and this is universally true.

According to Islam, the world is divided into dar al-harb (the house of war) and dar al-Islam (the house of Islam). Peace will arrive when the entire world is united under the flag of Allah. Hence, it is imperative to Islamize the nations within dar al-harb.

The greater the number of people present, the less likely an individual is to help someone in need because it is easier to rationalize that someone else will do it. It is easy to diffuse responsibility to others who are willing to stick their necks out: “Thank you, Dr. Saad, for standing up on our behalf. I really support your efforts. You got this.” No, I don’t. Everybody has a voice. Activate your sense of personal responsibility. You have agency. Participate. Do not be a bystander as truth, reason, and logic call out for your help. Do not subcontract your voice to others. Do not self-censor. You and your children have a stake in the outcome of this battle, so don’t be afraid to speak up. Do not succumb to the Tragedy of the Commons (as popularized by the ecologist Garrett Hardin in 1968), in this case a tragedy of collective inaction.

Politicians seek to outdo one another in offering vacuous “heartfelt” condolences while in many cases continuing to enact policies that are directly responsible for the terror attacks in question. In the great majority of instances, these are utterly useless endeavors meant to do nothing but advertise one’s supposed virtue to the world (hence the term virtue-signaling). It is a form of cheap and costless self-aggrandizing that feeds one’s ego. I must be a good person who truly cares, as evidenced by my progressive hashtag. Nothing could be further from the truth. Those who engage in such platitudinous signaling are cowardly and meek. I’ll use some fundamental principles from evolutionary biology to explain why this is so.

To scrutinize radical feminism does not make you a misogynist. To question open borders does not make you a racist. You can have an open heart filled with empathy and compassion and yet reject open borders. To assert that trans women (biological males) should not be competing in athletic competitions with biological females does not make you a transphobe. Many situations in life involve a calculus of competing rights. With that in mind, the right of your eight-year-old daughter to feel comfortable and safe in a public bathroom supersedes that of a 230-pound, six foot two trans woman. To reject the idea that so-called “other forms of knowing” (whether the indigenous way of knowing or postmodernism) are as valid as the scientific method does not make you a close-minded bigot. To reject the hysterical demonization of white men as exemplars of toxic masculinity and white supremacy does not make you Adolf Hitler. The name-calling accusations are locked and loaded threats, ready to be deployed against you should you dare to question the relevant progressive tenets. Most people are too afraid to be accused of being racist or misogynist, and so they cower in silence. Keep your mouth shut and nod in agreement or else prepare to be tarred and feathered. Don’t fall prey to this silencing strategy. Be assured in your principles and stand ready to defend them with the ferocity of a honey badger.
